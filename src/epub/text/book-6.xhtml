					<span>The waies, through which my weary steps I guyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In this delightfull land of Faery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are so exceeding spacious and wyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sprinckled with such sweet variety</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all that pleasant is to eare or eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I, nigh ravisht with rare thoughts delight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My tedious travell doe forget thereby;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, when I gin to feele decay of might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It strength to me supplies, and chears my dulled spright.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Such secret comfort and such heavenly pleasures,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ye sacred imps, that on Parnasso dwell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And there the keeping have of learnings threasures</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which doe all worldly riches farre excell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the mindes of mortall men doe well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And goodly fury into them infuse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Guyde ye my footing, and conduct me well</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In these strange waies where never foote did use,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne none can find but who was taught them by the Muse.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Revele to me the sacred noursery</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of vertue, which with you doth there remaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where it in silver bowre does hidden ly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From view of men, and wicked worlds disdaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since it at first was by the Gods with paine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Planted in earth, being derived at furst</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From heavenly seedes of bounty soveraine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by them long with carefull labour nurst,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till it to ripenesse grew, and forth to honour burst.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Amongst them all growes not a fayrer flowre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then is the bloosme of comely courtesie;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which though it on a lowly stalke doe bowre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet brancheth forth in brave nobilitie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And spreds it selfe through all civilitie:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which though present age doe plenteous seeme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet, being matcht with plaine Antiquitie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ye will them all but fayned showes esteeme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which carry colours faire that feeble eies misdeeme.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, in the triall of true curtesie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its now so farre from that which then it was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it indeed is nought but forgerie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fashion’d to please the eies of them that pas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which see not perfect things but in a glas:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet is that glasse so gay, that it can blynd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The wisest sight to thinke gold that is bras;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But vertues seat is deepe within the mynd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not in outward shows, but inward thoughts defynd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But where shall I in all Antiquity</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So faire a patterne finde, where may be scene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The goodly praise of Princely curtesie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As in your selfe, O soveraine Lady Queene?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In whose pure minde, as in a mirrour sheene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It showes, and with her brightnesse doth inflame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The eyes of all which thereon fixed beene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But meriteth indeede an higher name:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet so from low to high uplifted is your fame.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then pardon me, most dreaded Soveraine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That from your selfe I doe this vertue bring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to your selfe doe it returne againe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So from the Ocean all rivers spring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And tribute backe repay as to their King:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Right so from you all goodly vertues well</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the rest which round about you ring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Faire Lords and Ladies which about you dwell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And doe adorne your Court where courtesies excell.</span>

					<span>Of court, it seemes, men Courtesie doe call,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For that it there most useth to abound;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And well beseemeth that in Princes hall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That vertue should be plentifully found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which of all goodly manners is the ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And roote of civill conversation:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Right so in Faery court it did redound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where curteous Knights and Ladies most did won</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all on earth, and made a matchlesse paragon.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But mongst them all was none more courteous Knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then Calidore, beloved over-all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In whom, it seemes, that gentlenesse of spright</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And manners mylde were planted naturall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which he adding comely guize withall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gracious speach, did steale mens hearts away:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nathlesse thereto he was full stout and tall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And well approv’d in batteilous affray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That him did much renowme, and far his fame display.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nc was there Knight ne was there Lady found</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In Faery court, but him did deare embrace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For his faire usage and conditions sound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which in all mcns liking gayned place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with the greatest purchast greatest giace:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which he could wisely use, and well apply,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To please the best, and th’evill to embase;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For he loathd leasing and base flattery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And loved simple truth and stedfast honesty.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And now he was in travell on his way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uppon an hard adventure sore bestad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whenas by chaunce he met uppon a day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With Artegall, returning yet halfe sad</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From his late conquest which he gotten had:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who when as each of other had a sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They knew them selves, and both their persons rad;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When Calidore thus first: “Haile, noblest Knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all this day on ground that breathen living spright!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Now tell, if please you, of the good successe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which ye have had in your late enterprize.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom Sir Artegall gan to expresse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His whole exploite and valorous emprize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In order as it did to him arize.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Now, happy man,” (sayd then Sir Calidore)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Which have, so goodly as ye can devize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Atchiev’d so hard a quest, as few before;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That shall you most renowmed make for evermore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But where ye ended have, now I begin</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To tread an endlesse trace, withouten guyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or good direction how to enter in,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or how to issue forth in waies untryde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In perils strange, in labours long and wide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which although good Fortune me befall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet shall it not by none be testifyde.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“What is that quest,” (quoth then Sir Artegall)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“That you into such perils presently doth call?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The Blattant Beast” (quoth he) “I doe pursew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And through the world incessantly doe chase,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till I him overtake, or else subdew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet know I not or how, or in what place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To find him out, yet still I forward trace.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“What is that Blattant Beast?” (then he replide.)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“It is a Monster bred of hellishe race,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(Then answered he) “which often hath annoyd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Good Knights and Ladies true, and many else destroyd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Of Cerberus whilome he was begot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fell Chimaera, in her darkesome den,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through fowle commixture of his filthy blot;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where he was fostred long in Stygian fen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till he to perfect ripenesse grew; and then</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into this wicked world he forth was sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be the plague and scourge of wretched men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom with vile tongue and venemous intent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sore doth wound, and bite, and cruelly torment.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Then, since the salvage Island I did leave,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sayd Artegall, “I such a Beast did see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which did seeme a thousand tongues to have,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all in spight and malice did agree;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which he bayd and loudly barkt at mee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if that he attonce would me devoure:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But I, that knew my selfe from perill free,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did nought regard his malice nor his powre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he the more his wicked poyson forth did poure.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“That surely is that Beast” (saide Calidore)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Which I pursue, of whom I am right glad</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To heare these tidings, which of none afore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through all my weary travell I have had;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet now some hope your words unto me add.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Now God you speed,” (quoth then Sir Artegall)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“And keepe your body from the daunger drad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For ye have much adoe to deale withall.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So both tooke goodly leave, and parted severall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sir Calidore thence travelled not long,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When as by chaunce a comely Squire he found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That thorough some more mighty enemies wrong</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both hand and foote unto a tree was bound;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, seeing him from farre, with piteous sound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his shrill cries him called to his aide:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom approching, in that painefull stound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When he him saw, for no demaunds he staide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But first him losde, and afterwards thus to him saide.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Unhappy Squire! what hard mishap thee brought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into this bay of perill and disgrace?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What cruell hand thy wretched thraldome wrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thee captyved in this shamefull place?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom he answered thus: “My haplesse case</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is not occasiond through my misdesert,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But through misfortune, which did me abase</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto this shame, and my young hope subvert,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere that I in her guilefull traines was well expert.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Not farre from hence, uppon yond rocky hill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hard by a streight, there stands a castle strong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which doth observe a custome lewd and ill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And it hath long mayntaind with mighty wrong:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For may no Knight nor Lady passe along</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That way, (and yet they needs must passe that way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By reason of the streight, and rocks among)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But they that Ladies lockes doe shave away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that knights berd, for toll which they for passage pay.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“A shamefull use as ever I did heare,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sayd Calidore, “and to be overthrowne.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But by what meanes did they at first it reare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And for what cause? tell, if thou have it knowne.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sayd then that Squire; “The Lady, which doth owne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This Castle, is by name Briana hight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then which a prouder Lady liveth none:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She long time hath deare lov’d a doughty Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sought to win his love by all the meanes she might.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“His name is Crudor; who, through high disdaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And proud despight of his selfe-pleasing mynd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Refused hath to yeeld her love againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Untill a Mantle she for him doe fynd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With beards of Knights and locks of Ladies lynd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which to provide she hath this Castle dight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And therein hath a Seneschall assynd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cald M aleffort, a man of mickle might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who executes her wicked will with worse despight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“He, this same day, as I that way did come</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With a faire Damzell, my beloved deare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In execution of her lawlesse doome</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did set uppon us flying both for feare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For little bootes against him hand to reare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Me first he tooke unhable to withstond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And whiles he her pursued every where,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till his returne unto this tree he bond;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne wote I surely whether her he yet have fond.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus whiles they spake they heard a ruefull shrieke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of one loud crying, which they streightway ghest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it was she the which for helpe did seeke.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tho, looking up unto the cry to lest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They saw that Carle from farre, with hand unblest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hayling that mayden by the yellow heare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all her garments from her snowy brest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from her head her lockes he nigh did teare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne would he spare for pitty, nor refraine for feare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which haynous sight when Calidore beheld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eftsoones he loosd that Squire, and so him left</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With hearts dismay and inward dolour queld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For to pursue that villaine, which had reft</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That piteous spoile by so injurious theft;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom overtaking, loude to him he cryde:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Leave, faytor, quickely that misgotten weft</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To him that hath it better justify de,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And turne thee soone to him of whom thou art defyde.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who, hearkning to that voice, him selfe upreard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And seeing him so fiercely towardes make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against him stoutly ran, as nought afeard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But rather more enrag’d for those words sake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with sterne count’naunce thus unto him spake:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Art thou the caytive that defyest me?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And for this Mayd, whose party thou doest take,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wilt give thy beard, though it but little bee?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet shall it not her lockes for raunsome fro me free.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that he fiercely at him flew, and layd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On hideous strokes with most importune might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That oft he made him stagger as unstayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And oft recuile to shunne his sharpe despight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Calidore, that was well skild in fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him long forbore, and still his spirite spar’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lying in waite how him he damadge might;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when he felt him shrinke, and come to ward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He greater grew, and gan to drive at him more hard.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like as a water-streame, whose swelling sourse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall drive a Mill, within strong bancks is pent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And long restrayned of his ready course,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So soone as passage is unto him lent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Break es forth, and makes his way more violent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such was the fury of Sir Calidore:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When once he felt his foeman to relent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He fiercely him pursu’d, and pressed sore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who as he still decayd so he encreased more.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The heavy burden of whose dreadfull might</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whenas the Carle no longer could sustaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His heart gan faint, and streight he tooke his flight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Toward the Castle, where, if need constraine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His hope of refuge used to remaine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom Calidore perceiving fast to flie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He him pursu’d and chaced through the plaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he for dread of death gan loude to crie</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the ward to open to him hastilie.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They, from the wall him seeing so aghast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The gate soone opened to receive him in;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Calidore did follow him so fast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That even in the Porch he him did win,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And cleft his head asunder to his chin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The carkasse tumbling downe within the dore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did choke the entraunce with a lumpe of sin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it could not be shut; whilest Calidore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did enter in, and slew the Porter on the flore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that the rest the which the Castle kept</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">About him flockt, and hard at him did lay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he them all from him full lightly swept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As doth a Steare, in heat of sommers day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With his long taile the bryzes brush away.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thence passing forth into the hall he came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where of the Lady selfe in sad dismay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He was ymett, who with uncomely shame</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gan him salute, and fowle upbrayd with faulty blame.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“False traytor Knight!” (said she) “no Knight at all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But scorne of armes, that hast with guilty hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Murdred my men, and slaine my Seneschall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now comest thou to rob my house unmand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And spoile my selfe that can not thee withstand?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet doubt thou not, but that some better Knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then thou, that shall thy treason understand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will it avenge, and pay thee with thy right;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if none do, yet shame shal thee with shame requight.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Much was the Knight abashed at that word;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet answer’d thus: “Not unto me the shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But to the shamefull doer it afford.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bloud is no blemish, for it is no blame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To punish those that doe deserve the same;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But they that breake bands of civilitie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wicked customes make, those doe defame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both noble armes and gentle curtesie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No greater shame to man then inhumanitie.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Then doe your selfe, for dread of shame, forgoe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This evill manner which ye here maintaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And doe instead thereof mild curt’sie showe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To all that passe: That shall you glory gaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More then his love, which thus ye seeke t’obtaine.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherewith all full of wrath she thus replyde:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Vile recreant! know that I doe much disdaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy courteous lore, that doest my love deride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who scornes thy ydle scoffe, and bids thee be defyde.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“To take defiaunce at a Ladies word”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(Quoth he) “I hold it no indignity;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But were he here, that would it with his sword</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Abett, perhaps he mote it deare aby.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Cowherd!” (quoth she) “were not that thou wouldst fly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere he doe come, he should be soone in place.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“If I doe so,” (sayd he) “then liberty</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I leave to you for aye me to disgrace</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With all those shames, that erst ye spake me to deface.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that a Dwarfe she cald to her in hast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And taking from her hand a ring of gould,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A privy token which betweene them past,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bad him to flie with all the speed he could</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To Crudor; and desire him that he would</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vouchsafe to reskue her against a Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who through strong powre had now her self in hould,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Having late slaine her Seneschall in fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all her people murdred with outragious might:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Dwarfe his way did hast, and went all night;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Calidore did with her there abyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The comming of that so much threatned Knight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where that discourteous Dame with scornfull pryde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fowle entreaty him indignifyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That yron heart it hardly could sustaine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet he, that could his wrath full wisely guyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did well endure her womanish disdaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And did him selfe from fraile impatience refraine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The morrow next, before the lampe of light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above the earth upreard his flaming head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Dwarfe, which bore that message to her knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Brought aunswere backe, that ere he tasted bread</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He would her succour, and alive or dead</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her foe deliver up into her hand:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore he wild her doe away all dread;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, that of him she mote assured stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sent to her his basenet as a faithfull band.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thereof full blyth the Lady streight became,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gan t’augment her bitternesse much more;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet no whit more appalled for the same,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ought dismayed was Sir Calidore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But rather did more chearefull seeme therefore:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And having soone his armes about him dight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did issue forth to meete his foe afore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where long he stayed not, when as a Knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He spide come pricking on with all his powre and might.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Well weend he streight that he should be the same</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which tooke in hand her quarrell to maintaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne stayd to aske if it were he by name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But coucht his speare, and ran at him amaine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They bene ymett in middest of the plaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With so fell fury and dispiteous forse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That neither could the others stroke sustaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But rudely rowld to ground, both man and horse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Neither of other taking pitty nor remorse.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Calidore uprose againe full light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whiles yet his foe lay fast in sencelesse swound;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet would he not him hurt although he might;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For shame he weend a sleeping wight to wound.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when Briana saw that drery stound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where she stood uppon the Castle wall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She deem’d him sure to have bene dead on ground;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And made such piteous mourning therewithall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That from the battlements she ready seem’d to fall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nathlesse at length him selfe he did upreare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In lustlesse wise; as if against his will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere he had slept his fill, he wakened were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gan to stretch his limbs; which feeling ill</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his late fall, awhile he rested still:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, when he saw his foe before in vew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He shooke off luskishnesse; and courage chill</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Kindling afresh, gan battell to renew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To prove if better foote then horsebacke would ensew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There then began a fearefull cruell fray</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Betwixt them two for maystery of might;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For both were wondrous practicke in that play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And passing well expert in single fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And both inflam’d with furious despight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which as it still encreast, so still increast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their cruell strokes and terrible affright;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne once for ruth their rigour they releast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne once to breath awhile their angers tempest ceast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus long they trac’d and traverst to and fro,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And tryde all waies how each mote entrance make</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the life of his malignant foe:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They hew’d their helmes, and plates asunder brake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As they had potshares bene; for nought mote slake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their greedy vengeaunces but goary blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That at the last like to a purple lake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of bloudy gore congeal’d about them stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which from their riven sides forth gushed like a flood.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At length it chaunst that both their hands on hie</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At once did heave with all their powre and might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thinking the utmost of their force to trie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And prove the finall fortune of the fight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Calidore, that was more quicke of sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And nimbler handed then his enemie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Prevented him before his stroke could light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on the helmet smote him formerlie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That made him stoupe to ground with meeke humilitie</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And, ere he could recover foote againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He, following that faire advantage fast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His stroke redoubled with such might and maine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That him upon the ground he groveling cast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And leaping to him light would have unlast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His Helme, to make unto his vengeance way:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, seeing in what daunger he was plast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cryde out; “Ah mercie, Sir! doe me not slay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But save my life, which lot before your foot doth lay.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that his mortall hand a while he stayd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, having somewhat calm’d his wrathfull heat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With goodly patience, thus he to him sayd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“And is the boast of that proud Ladies threat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That menaced me from the field to beat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now brought to this? By this now may ye learne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Strangers no more so rudely to entreat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But put away proud looke and usage sterne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The which shal nought to you but foule dishonor yearne.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“For nothing is more blamefull to a knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That court’sie doth as well as armes professe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">However strong and fortunate in fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then the reproch of pride and cruelnesse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In vaine he seeketh others to suppresse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who hath not learnd him selfe first to subdew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All flesh is frayle and full of ficklenesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Subject to fortunes chance, still chaunging new:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What haps to day to me to morrow may to you.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Who will not mercie unto others shew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How can he mercy ever hope to have?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To pay each with his owne is right and dew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet since ye mercie now doe need to crave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I will it graunt, your hopelesse life to save,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With these conditions which I will propound:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">First, that ye better shall your selfe behave</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto all errant knights, whereso on ground;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Next, that ye Ladies ayde in every stead and stound.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The wretched man, that all this while did dwell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In dread of death, his heasts did gladly heare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And promist to performe his precept well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And whatsoever else he would requere.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So, suffring him to rise, he made him sweare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By his owne sword, and by the crosse thereon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To take Briana for his loving fere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Withouten dowre or composition;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to release his former foule condition.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All which accepting, and with faithfull oth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bynding himselfe most firmely to obay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He up arose, however liefe or loth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And swore to him true fealtie for aye.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then forth he cald from sorrowfull dismay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sad Briana which all this beheld;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who comming forth yet full of late affray</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sir Calidore upcheard, and to her teld</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All this accord to which he Cruder had compeld.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whereof she now more glad then sory earst,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All overcome with infinite affect</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For his exceeding courtesie, that pearst</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her stubborne hart with inward deepe effect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before his feet her selfe she did project;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And him adoring as her lives deare Lord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With all due thankes and dutifull respect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her selfe acknowledg’d bound for that accord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By which he had to her both life and love restord.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So all returning to the Castle glad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Most joyfully she them did entertaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where goodly glee and feast to them she made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To show her thankefull mind and meaning faine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By all the meanes she mote it best explaine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, after all, unto Sir Calidore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She freely gave that Castle for his paine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And her selfe bound to him for evermore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So wondrously now chaung’d from that she was afore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Calidore himselfe would not retaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor land nor fee for hyre of his good deede,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But gave them streight unto that Squire againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom from her Seneschall he lately freed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to his damzell, as their rightfull meed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For recompence of all their former wrong.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There he remaind with them right well agreed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till of his wounds he wexed hole and strong;</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which he wont to launch the salvage hart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of many a Lyon and of many a Beare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That first unto his hand in chase did happen neare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whom Calidore awhile well having vewed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At length bespake; “What meanes this, gentle Swaine?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Why hath thy hand too bold it selfe embrewed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In blood of knight, the which by thee is slaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By thee no knight; which armes impugneth plaine?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Certes,” (said he) “loth were I to have broken</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The law of armes: yet breake it should againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rather then let my selfe of wight be stroken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So long as these two armes were able to be wroken.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“For not I him, as this his Ladie here</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">May witnesse well, did offer first to wrong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne surely thus unarm’d I likely were;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he me first through pride and puissance strong</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Assayld, not knowing what to armes doth long.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Perdie great blame” (then said Sir Calidore)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“For armed knight a wight unarm’d to wrong:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But then aread, thou gentle chyld, wherefore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Betwixt you two began this strife and sterne uprore.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“That shall I, sooth,” (said he) “to you declare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I, whose unryper yeares are yet unfit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For thing of weight or worke of greater care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doe spend my dayes and bend my carelesse wit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To salvage chace, where I thereon may hit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In all this forrest and wyld wooddie raine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where, as this day I was enraunging it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I chaunst to meete this knight, who there lyes slaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Together with this Ladie, passing on the plaine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The knight, as ye did see, on horsebacke was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this his Ladie (that him ill became)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On her faire feet by his horse side did pas</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through thicke and thin, unfit for any Dame:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet not content, more to increase his shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When so she lagged, as she needs mote so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He with his speare, that was to him great blame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would thumpe her forward and inforce to goe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Weeping to him in vaine and making piteous woe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Which when I saw, as they me passed by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Much was I moved in indignant mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gan to blame him for such cruelty</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Towards a Ladie, whom with usage kind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He rather should have taken up behind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherewith he wroth, and full of proud disdaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tooke in foule scorne that I such fault did find,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And me in lieu thereof revil’d againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Threatning to chastize me, as doth t’a chyld pertaine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Which I no lesse disdayning, backe returned</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His scornefull taunts unto his teeth againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he streightway with haughtie choler burned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with his speare strooke me one stroke or twaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which I, enforst to beare though to my paine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cast to requite; and with a slender dart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fellow of this I beare, throwne not in vaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Strooke him, as seemeth, underneath the hart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That through the wound his spirit shortly did depart.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Much did Sir Calidore admyre his speach</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tempred so well, but more admyr’d the stroke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That through the mayles had made so strong a breach</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into his hart, and had so sternely wroke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His wrath on him that first occasion broke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet rested not, but further gan inquire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that same Ladie, whether what he spoke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were soothly so, and that th’unrighteous ire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of her owne knight had given him his owne due hire?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Of all which when as she could nought deny,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But cleard that stripling of th’imputed blame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sayd then Sir Calidore; “Neither will I</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him charge with guilt, but rather doe quite clame:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For what he spake, for you he spake it, Dame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And what he did, he did him selfe to save:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against both which that knight wrought knightlesse shame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For knights and all men this by nature have,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Towards all womenkind them kindly to behave.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, sith that he is gone irrevocable,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Please it you, Ladie, to us to aread</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What cause could make him so dishonourable</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To drive you so on foot, unfit to tread</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And lackey by him, gainst all womanhead.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Certes, Sir knight,” (sayd she) “full loth I were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To rayse a lyving blame against the dead;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But since it me concernes my selfe to clere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will the truth discover as it chaunst whylere.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“This day, as he and I together roade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon our way to which we weren bent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We chaunst to come foreby a covert glade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within a wood, whereas a Ladie gent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sate with a knight in joyous jolliment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of their franke loves, free from all gealous spyes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Faire was the Ladie, sure, that mote content</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An hart not carried with too curious eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And unto him did shew all lovely courtesyes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Whom when my knight did see so lovely faire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He inly gan her lover to envy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wish that he part of his spoyle might share:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereto when as my presence he did spy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be a let, he bad me by and by</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For to alight: but when as I was loth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My loves owne part to leave so suddenly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He with strong hand downe from his steed me throw’th</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with presumpteous powre against that knight streight go’th.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Unarm’d all was the knight, as then more meete</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For Ladies service, and for loves delight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then fearing any foeman there to meete:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereof he taking oddes, streight bids him dight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Himselfe to yeeld his Love, or else to fight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat the other starting up dismayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet boldly answer’d, as he rightly might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To leave his love he should be ill apayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which he had good right gaynst all that it gainesayd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Yet since he was not presently in plight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her to defend, or his to justifie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He him requested, as he was a knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To lend him day his better right to trie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or stay till he his armes, which were thereby,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Might lightly fetch: But he was fierce and whot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne time would give, nor any termes aby,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But at him flew, and with his speare him smot;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From which to thinke to save himselfe it booted not.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Meane while his Ladie, which his outrage saw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whilest they together for the quarrey strove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the covert did her selfe withdraw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And closely hid her selfe within the grove.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My knight hers soone, as seemes, to daunger drove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And left sore wounded: but, when her he mist,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He woxe halfe mad; and in that rage gan rove</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And range through all the wood, where so he wist</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She hidden was, and sought her so long as him list.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But, when as her he by no meanes could find,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After long search and chauff he turned backe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the place where me he left behind:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There gan he me to curse and ban, for lacke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that faire bootie, and with bitter wracke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To wreake on me the guilt of his owne wrong:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all which I yet glad to beare the packe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Strove to appease him, and perswaded long;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But still his passion grew more violent and strong.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Then, as it were t’avenge his wrath on mee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When forward we should fare he flat refused</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To take me up (as this young man did see)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon his steed, for no just cause accused,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But forst to trot on foot, and foule misused,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pounching me with the butt end of his speare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In vaine complayning to be so abused;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For he regarded neither playnt nor teare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But more enforst my paine, the more my plaints to heare,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“So passed we till this young man us met;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And being moov’d with pittie of my plight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Spake, as was meet, for ease of my regret:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereof befell what now is in your sight.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Now sure,” (then said Sir Calidore) “and right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Me seemes, that him befell by his owne fault:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who ever thinkes through confidence of might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or through support of count’nance proud and hault,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To wrong the weaker, oft falles in his owne assault.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then turning: backe unto that gentle boy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which had himselfe so stoutly well acquit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeing his face so lovely sterne and coy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hearing th’answeres of his pregnant wit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He praysd it much, and much admyred it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That sure he weend him borne of noble blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With whom those graces did so goodly fit:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And when he long had him beholding stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He burst into these wordes, as to him seemed good:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Faire gentle swayne, and yet as stout as fayre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in these woods amongst the Nymphs dost wonne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which daily may to thy sweete lookes repayre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As they are wont unto Latonaes sonne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After his chace on woodie Cynthus donne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well may I, certes, such an one thee read,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As by thy worth thou worthily hast wonne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or surely borne of some Heroicke sead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in thy face appeares and gratious goodlyhead.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But, should it not displease thee it to tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(Unlesse thou in these woods thy selfe conceale</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For love amongst the woodie Gods to dwell)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I would thy selfe require thee to reveale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For deare affection and unfayned zeale</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which to thy noble personage I beare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wish thee grow in worship and great weale;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For, since the day that armes I first did reare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I never saw in any greater hope appeare.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To whom then thus the noble Youth: “May be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sir knight, that, by discovering my estate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Harme may arise unweeting unto me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nathelesse, sith ye so courteous seemed late,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To you I will not feare it to relate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then wote ye that I am a Briton borne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sonne of a King, (how ever thorough fate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or fortune I my countrie have forlorne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lost the crowne which should my head by right adorne,)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“And Tristram is my name, the onely heire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of good king Meliogras which did rayne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In Cornewale, till that he through lives despeire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Untimely dyde, before I did attaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ripe yeares of reason my right to maintaine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After whose death his brother, seeing mee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An infant, weake a kingdome to sustaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon him tooke the roiall high degree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sent me, where him list, instructed for to bee.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The widow Queene my mother, which then hight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Faire Emiline, conceiving then great feare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of my fraile safetie, resting in the might</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of him that did the kingly Scepter beare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose gealous dread induring not a peare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is wont to cut off all that doubt may breed,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Of dreaded daunger might his doubtfull humor feed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“So, taking counsell of a wise man red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She was by him adviz’d to send me quight</span>

					<span class="i1">Should weet of me, nor worke me any wrong:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whose wise read she hearkning sent me streight</span>

					<span>Since I was ten yeares old, now growen to stature strong.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“All which my daies I have not lewdly spent,</span>

					<span class="i1">Nor spilt the blossome of my tender yeares</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In ydlesse; but, as was convenient,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such be our joy es which in these forrests grow:</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The rather, since that fortune hath this day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Given to me the spoile of this dead knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These goodly gilden armes which I have won in fight.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All which when well Sir Calidore had heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him much more now then earst he gan admire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the rare hope which in his yeares appear’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thus replide: “Faire chyld, the high desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To love of armes, which in you doth aspire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I may not, certes, without blame denie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But rather wish that some more noble hire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(Though none more noble then is chevalrie)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I had, you to reward with greater dignitie.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There him he causd to kneele, and made to sweare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Faith to his knight, and truth to Ladies all,</span>

					<span class="i1">And never to be recreant for feare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of perill, or of ought that might befall:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So he him dubbed, and his Squire did call.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full glad and joyous then young Tristram grew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like as a flowre, whose silken leaves small</span>
					<br/>

					<span>At length breakes forth, and brode displayes his smyling hew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus when they lone had treated to and fro,</span>

					<span class="i1">And Calidore betooke him to depart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Chyld Tristram prayd that he with him might goe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On his adventure, vowing not to start,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But wayt on him in every place and part:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat Sir Calidore did much delight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And greatly joy’d at his so noble hart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In hope he sure would prove a doughtie knight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet for the time this answere he to him behight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Glad would I surely be, thou courteous Squire,</span>

					<span class="i1">To have thy presence in my present quest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That mote thy kindled courage set on fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And flame forth honour in thy noble brest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But I am bound by vow, which I profest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To my dread Soveraine, when I it assayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in atchievement of her high behest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I should no creature joyne unto mine ayde:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For-thy I may not graunt that ye so greatly prayde.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But since this Ladie is all desolate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And needeth safegard now upon her way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ye may doe well, in this her needfull state,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To succour her from daunger of dismay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That thankfull guerdon may to you repay.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The noble ympe, of such new service fayne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It gladly did accept, as he did say:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So taking courteous leave they parted twayne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Calidore forth passed to his former payne.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Tristram, then despoyling that dead knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all those goodly implements of prayse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Long fed his greedie eyes with the faire sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the bright mettall shyning like Sunne rayes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Handling and turning them a thousand wayes:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, after having them upon him dight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He tooke that Ladie, and her up did rayse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the steed of her owne late dead knight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So with her marched forth, as she did him behight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There to their fortune leave we them awhile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And turne we backe to good Sir Calidore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, ere he thence had traveild many a mile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came to the place whereas ye heard afore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This knight, whom Tristram slew, had wounded sore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another knight in his despiteous pryde:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There he that knight found lying on the flore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With many wounds full perilous and wyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That all his garments and the grasse in vermeill dyde.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And there beside him sate upon the ground</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His wofull Ladie, piteously complayning</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With loud laments that most unluckie stound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And her sad selfe with carefull hand constrayning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To wype his wounds, and ease their bitter payning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which sorie sight when Calidore did vew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With heavie eyne, from teares uneath refrayning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His mightie hart their mournefull case can rew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for their better comfort to them nigher drew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then speaking to the Ladie thus he said:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Ye dolefull Dame, let not your griefe empeach</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To tell what cruell hand hath thus arayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This knight unarm’d with so unknightly breach</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of armes, that, if I yet him nigh may reach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I may avenge him of so foule despight.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Ladie, hearing his so courteous speach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gan reare her eyes as to the chearefull light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And from her sory hart few heavie words forth sight:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In which she shew’d, how that discourteous knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(Whom Tristram slew) them in that shadow found</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Joying together in unblam’d delight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And him unarm’d, as now he lay on ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Charg’d with his speare, and mortally did wound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Withouten cause, but onely her to reave</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From him to whom she was for ever bound:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet when she fled into that covert greave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He, her not finding, both them thus nigh dead did leave.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When Calidore this ruefull storie had</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well understood, he gan of her demand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What manner wight he was, and how yclad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which had this outrage wrought with wicked hand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She then, like as she best could understand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him thus describ’d; to be of stature large,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Clad all in gilden armes, with azure band</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Quartred athwart, and bearing in his targe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A Ladie on rough waves row’d in a sommer barge.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then gan Sir Calidore to ghesse streightway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By many signes which she described had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That this was he whom Tristram earst did slay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to her said: “Dame, be no longer sad;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For he, that hath your Knight so ill bestad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is now him selfe in much more wretched plight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These eyes him saw upon the cold earth sprad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The meede of his desert for that despight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which to your selfe he wrought and to your loved knight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Therefore, faire Lady, lay aside this griefe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which ye have gathered to your gentle hart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For that displeasure, and thinke what reliefe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were best devise for this your lovers smart;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And how ye may him hence, and to what part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Convay to be recur’d.” She thankt him deare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both for that newes he did to her impart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And for the courteous care which he did beare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both to her love and to her selfe in that sad dreare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet could she not devise by any wit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How thence she might convay him to some place;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For him to trouble she it thought unfit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That was a straunger to her wretched case;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And him to beare she thought it thing too base.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which when as he perceiv’d he thus bespake:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Faire Lady, let it not you seeme disgrace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To beare this burden on your dainty backe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My selfe will beare a part, coportion of your packe.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So off he did his shield, and downeward layd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the ground, like to an hollow beare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And powring balme, which he had long purvayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into his wounds, him up thereon did reare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And twixt them both with parted paines did beare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Twixt life and death, not knowing what was donne.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thence they him carried to a Castle neare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which a worthy auncient Knight did wonne:</span>

					<span>True is, that whilome that good Poet sayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The gentle minde by gentle deeds is knowne:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For a man by nothing is so well bewrayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As by his manners; in which plaine is showne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of what degree and what race he is growne:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For seldome scene a trotting Stalion get</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An ambling Colt, that is his proper owne:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So seldome scene that one in basenesse set</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Doth noble courage shew with curteous manners met.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But evermore contrary hath bene tryde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That gentle bloud will gentle manners breed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As well may be in Calidore descryde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By late ensample of that courteous deed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Done to that wounded Knight in his great need,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom on his backe he bore, till he him brought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the Castle where they had decreed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There of the Knight, the which that Castle ought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make abode that night he greatly was besought.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He was to weete a man of full ripe yeares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in his youth had beene of mickle might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And borne great sway in armes amongst his peares;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But now weake age had dimd his candle-light:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet was he courteous still to every wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And loved all that did to armes incline;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And was the Father of that wounded Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom Calidore thus carried on his chine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Aldus was his name; and his sonnes, Aladine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who when he saw his sonne so ill bedight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With bleeding wounds, brought home upon a beare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By a faire Lady and a straunger Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was inly touched with compassion deare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And deare affection of so dolefull dreare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he these words burst forth: “Ah, sory boy!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is this the hope that to my hoary heare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou brings? aie me! is this the timely joy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which I expected long, now turnd to sad annoy?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Such is the weakenesse of all mortall hope,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So tickle is the state of earthly things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, ere they come unto their aymed scope,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They fall too short of our fraile reckonings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And bring us bale and bitter sorrowings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Instead of comfort which we should embrace:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This is the state of Keasars and of Kings!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let none therefore, that is in meaner place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Too greatly grieve at any his unlucky case.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So well and wisely did that good old Knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Temper his griefe, and turned it to cheare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To cheare his guests whom he had stayd that night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And make their welcome to them well appeare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That to Sir Calidore was easie geare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that faire Lady would be cheard for nought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But sigh’d and sorrow’d for her lover deare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And inly did afflict her pensive thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With thinking to what case her name should now be brought:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For she was daughter to a noble Lord</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which dwelt thereby, who sought her to afry</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To a great pere; but she did disaccord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne could her liking to his love apply,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But lov’d this fresh young Knight who dwelt her ny,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The lusty Aladine, though meaner borne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of lesse livelood and hability,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet full of valour the which did adorne</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His meanesse much, and make her th’others riches scorne.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So, having both found fit occasion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They met together in that lucklesse glade;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where that proud Knight in his presumption</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The gentle Aladine did earst invade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Being unarm’d and set in secret shade.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereof she now bethinking, gan t’advize</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How great a hazard she at earst had made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of her good fame; and further gan devize</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How she the blame might salve with coloured disguize.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Calidore with all good courtesie</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fain’d her to frolicke, and to put away</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The pensive fit of her melancholic;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that old Knight by all meanes did assay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To make them both as merry as he may.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So they the evening past till time of rest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When Calidore in seemly good array</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto his bowre was brought, and there undrest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did sleepe all night through weary travell of his quest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But faire Priscilla (so that Lady hight)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would to no bed, nor take no kindely sleepe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But by her wounded love did watch all night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the night for bitter anguish weepe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with her teares his wounds did wash and steepe:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So well she washt them, and so well she wacht him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That of the deadly swound, in which full deepe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He drenched was, she at the length dispacht him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And drove away the stound which mortally attacht him.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The morrow next, when day gan to uplooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He also gan uplooke with drery eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like one that out of deadly dreame awooke:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where when he saw his faire Priscilla by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He deepely sigh’d, and groaned inwardly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To thinke of this ill state in which she stood;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which she for his sake had weetingly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now brought her selfe, and blam’d her noble blood:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For first, next after life, he tendered her good.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which she perceiving did with plenteous teares</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His care more then her owne compassionate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">rorgethill of her owne to mmde his feares:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So both conspiring gan to intimate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Each others griefe with zeale affectionate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And twixt them twaine with equall care to cast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How to save hole her hazarded estate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For which the onely helpe now left them last</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seem’d to be Calidore: all other helpes were past.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Him they did deeme, as sure to them he seemed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A courteous Knight and full of faithfull trust;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore to him their cause they best esteemed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whole to commit, and to his dealing just.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Earely, so soone as Titans beames forth brust</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through the thicke clouds in which they steeped lay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All night in darkenesse, duld with yron rust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Calidore rising up as fresh as day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gan freshly him addresse unto his former way.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But first him seemed fit that wounded Knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To visite, after this nights perillous passe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to salute him, if he were in plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke that Lady, his faire lovely lasse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There he him found much better then he was;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And moved speach to him of things of course,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The anguish of his paine to overpasse:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mongst which he namely did to him discourse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of former daies mishap, his sorrowes wicked sourse.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Of which occasion Aldine taking hold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gan breake to him the fortunes of his love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all his disadventures to unfold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Calidore it dearly deepe did move:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In th’end, his kyndly courtesie to prove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He him by all the bands of love besought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And as it mote a faithfull friend behove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To safe-conduct his love, and not for ought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To leave, till to her fathers house he had her brought.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sir Calidore his faith thereto did plight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It to performe: so after little stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That she her selfe had to the journey dight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He passed forth with her in faire array,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fearlesse who ought did thinke or ought did say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sith his own thought he knew most cleare from wite</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So, as they past together on their way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He can devize this counter-cast of slight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To give faire colour to that Ladies cause in sight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Streight to the carkasse of that Knight he went-,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The cause of all this evill, who was slaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The day before by just avengement</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of noble Tristram, where it did remaine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There he the necke thereof did cut in twaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And tooke with him the head, the signe of shame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So forth he passed thorough that daies paine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till to that Ladies fathers house he came;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Most pensive man, through feare what of his childe became.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There he arriving boldly did present</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The fearefull Lady to her father deare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Most perfect pure, and guiltlesse innocent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of blame, as he did on his Knighthood sweare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since first he saw her, and did free from feare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of a discourteous Knight, who her had reft</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by outragious force away did beare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Witnesse thereof he shew’d his head there left,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wretched life forlorne for vengement of his theft.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Most joyfull man her sire was her to see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And heare th’adventure of her late mischaunce;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thousand thankes to Calidore for fee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his large paines in her deliveraunce</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did yeeld: Ne lesse the Lady did advaunce.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus having her restored trustily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he had vow’d, some small continuance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He there did make, and then most carefully</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto his first exploite he did him selfe apply.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So, as he was pursuing of his quest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He chaunst to come whereas a jolly Knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In covert shade him selfe did safely rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To solace with his Lady in delight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His warlike armes he had from him undight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For that him selfe he thought from daunger free,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And far from envious eyes that mote him spight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke the Lady was full faire to see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And courteous withall, becomming her degree.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To whom Sir Calidore approaching nye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere they were well aware of living wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Them much abasht, but more him selfe thereby,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he so rudely did uppon them light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And troubled had their quiet loves delight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet since it was his fortune, not his fault,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him selfe thereof he labour’d to acquite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And pardon crav’d for his so rash default,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he gainst courtesie so fowly did default.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With which his gentle words and goodly wit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He soone allayd that Knights conceiv’d displeasure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he besought him downe by him to sit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That they mote treat of things abrode at leasure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of adventures, which had in his measure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of so long waies to him befallen late.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So downe he sate, and with delightfull pleasure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His long adventures gan to him relate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which he endured had through daungerous debate:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Of which whitest they discoursed both together,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The faire Serena (so his Lady hight)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Allur’d with myldnesse of the gentle wether</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And pleasaunce of the place, the which was dight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With divers flowres distinct with rare delight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wandred about the fields, as liking led</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her wavering lust after her wandring sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To make a garland to adorne her hed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without suspect of ill or daungers hidden dred.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All sodainely out of the Forrest nere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Blatant Beast forth rushing unaware</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Caught her, thus loosely wandring here and there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in his wide great mouth away her bare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Crying aloud to shew her sad misfare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the Knights, and calling oft for ayde;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who with the horrour of her haplesse care</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hastily starting up, like men dismayde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ran after fast to reskue the distressed mayde.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Beast, with their pursuit incited more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the wood was bearing her apace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For to have spoyled her, when Calidore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who was more light of foote and swift in chace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him overtooke in middest of his race;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, fiercely charging him with all his might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forst to forgoe his pray there in the place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to betake him selfe to fearefull flight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he durst not abide with Calidore to fight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who nathelesse, when he the Lady saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There left on ground, though in full evill plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet knowing that her Knight now neare did draw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Staide not to succour her in that affright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But follow’d fast the Monster in his flight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through woods and hils he follow’d him so fast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he nould let him breath, nor gather spright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But forst him gape and gaspe, with dread aghast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if his lungs and lites were nigh asunder brast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And now by this Sir Calepine (so hight)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came to the place where he his Lady found</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In dolorous dismay and deadly plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All in gore bloud there tumbled on the ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Having both sides through grypt with griesly wound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His weapons soone from him he threw away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And stouping downe to her in drery swound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uprear’d her from the ground whereon she lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his tender armes her forced up to stay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So well he did his busie paines apply,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the faint sprite he did revoke againe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To her fraile mansion of mortality:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then up he tooke her twixt his armes twaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And setting on his steede her did sustaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With carefull hands, soft footing her beside;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till to some place of rest they mote attaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where she in safe assuraunce mote abide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till she recured were of those her woundes wide.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now when as Phoebus with his fiery waine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto his Inne began to draw apace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tho wexing weary of that toylesome paine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In travelling on foote so long a space,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not wont on foote with heavy armes to trace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Downe in a dale forby a rivers syde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He chaunst to spie a faire and stately place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which he meant his weary steps to guyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In hope there for his love some succour to provyde.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, comming to the rivers side, he found</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That hardly passable on foote it was;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore there still he stood as in a stound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne wist which way he through the foord mote pas:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus whilest he was in this distressed case,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Devising what to doe, he nigh espyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An armed Knight approaching to the place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With a faire Lady lincked by his syde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The which themselves prepard thorough the foord to ride.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whom Calepine saluting (as became)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Besought of courtesie, in that his neede,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For safe conducting of his sickely Dame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through that same perillous foord with better heede,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To take him up behinde upon his steed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom that other did this taunt returne:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Perdy, thou peasant Knight mightst rightly reed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Me then to be full base and evill borne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If I would beare behinde a burden of such scorne.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But, as thou hast thy steed forlorne with shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So fare on foote till thou another gayne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And let thy Lady likewise doe the same,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or beare her on thy backe with pleasing payne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And prove thy manhood on the billowes vayne.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which rude speach his Lady much displeased</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did him reprove, yet could him not restrayne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And would on her owne Palfrey him have eased,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For pitty of his Dame whom she saw so diseased.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sir Calepine her thanckt; yet, inly wroth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against her Knight, her gentlenesse refused,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And carelesly into the river goth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As in despight to be so fowle abused</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of a rude churle, whom often he accused</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of fowle discourtesie, unfit for Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, strongly wading through the waves unused,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With speare in th’one hand stayd him selfe upright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With th’other staide his Lady up with steddy might.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And all the while that same discourteous Knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stood on the further bancke beholding him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At whose calamity, for more despight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He laught, and mockt to see him like to swim:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when as Calepine came to the brim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And saw his carriage past that perill well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Looking at that same Carle with count’nance grim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His heart with vengeaunce inwardly did swell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forth at last did breake in speaches sharpe and fell</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Unknightly Knight, the blemish of that name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And blot of all that armes uppon them take,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which is the badge of honour and of fame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Loe! I defie thee; and here challenge make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That thou for ever doe those armes forsake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And be for ever held a recreant Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unlesse thou dare, for thy deare Ladies sake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And for thine owne defence, on foote alight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To justifie thy fault gainst me in equall fight.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The dastard, that did heare him selfe defyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seem’d not to weigh his threatfull words at all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But laught them out, as if his greater pryde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did scorne the challenge of so base a thrall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or had no courage, or else had no gall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So much the more was Calepine offended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That him to no revenge he forth could call,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But both his challenge and him selfe contemned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No cared as a coward so to be condemned.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But he, nought weighing what he sayd or did,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turned his steede about another way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with his Lady to the Castle rid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where was his won: ne did the other stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But after went directly as he may,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For his sicke charge some harbour there to seeke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where he arriving with the fall of day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drew to the gate, and there with prayers meeke</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And myld entreaty lodging did for her beseeke.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But the rude Porter that no manners had</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did shut the gate against him in his face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And entraunce boldly unto him forbad:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nathelesse the Knight, now in so needy case,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gan him entreat even with submission base,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And humbly praid to let them in that night;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who to him aunswer’d, that there was no place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of lodging fit for any errant Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unlesse that with his Lord he formerly did fight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Full loth am I,” (quoth he) “as now at earst</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When day is spent, and rest us needeth most,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that this Lady, both whose sides are pearst</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With wounds, is ready to forgo the ghost;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne would I gladly combate with mine host,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That should to me such curtesie afford,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unlesse that I were thereunto enforst:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But yet aread to me, how hight thy Lord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That doth thus strongly ward the Castle of the Ford?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“His name,” (quoth he) “if that thou list to learne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is hight Sir Turpine, one of mickle might</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And manhood rare, but terrible and stearne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In all assaies to every errant Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because of one that wrought him fowle despight.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“111 seemes,” (sayd he) “if he so valiaunt be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he should be so sterne to stranger wight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For seldome yet did living creature see</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That curtesie and manhood ever disagree.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But go thy waies to him, and fro me say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That here is at his gate an errant Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That house-rome craves; yet would be loth t’assay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The proofe of battell now in doubtfull night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or curtesie with rudenesse to requite:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet, if he needes will fight, crave leave till morne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And tell with all the lamentable plight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which this Lady languisheth forlorne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That pitty craves, as he of woman was yborne.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The groome went streight way in, and to his Lord</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Declar’d the message which that Knight did move:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, sitting with his Lady then at bord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not onely did not his demaund approve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But both himselfe revil’d and eke his love;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Albe his Lady, that Blandina hight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him of ungentle usage did reprove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And earnestly entreated, that they might</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Finde favour to be lodged there for that same night.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet would he not perswaded be for ought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne from his currish will a whit reclame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which answer when the groome returning brought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To Calepine, his heart did inly flame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With wrathfull fury for so foule a shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he could not thereof avenged bee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But most for pitty of his dearest Dame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom now in deadly daunger he did see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet had no meanes to comfort, nor procure her glee.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But all in vaine; for-why no remedy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He saw the present mischiefe to redresse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But th’utmost end perforce for to aby,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which that nights fortune would for him addresse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So downe he tooke his Lady in distresse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And layd her underneath a bush to sleepe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cover’d with cold, and wrapt in wretchednesse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whiles he him selfe all night did nought but weepe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wary watch about her for her safegard keepe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The morrow next, so soone as joyous day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did shew it selfe in sunny beames bedight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Serena full of dolorous dismay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Twixt darkenesse dread and hope of living light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uprear’d her head to see that chearefull sight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then Calepine, however inly wroth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And greedy to avenge that vile despight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet for the feeble Ladies sake, full loth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make there lenger stay, forth on his journey goth.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He goth on foote all armed by her side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upstaying still her selfe uppon her steede,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Being unhable else alone to ride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So sore her sides, so much her wounds did bleede;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till that at length, in his extreamest neede,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He chaunst far off an armed Knight to spy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pursuing him apace with greedy speede;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom well he wist to be some enemy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That meant to make advantage of his misery.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Wherefore he stayd, till that he nearer drew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To weet what issue would thereof betyde:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tho, whenas he approched nigh in vew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By certaine signes he plainly him descryde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be the man that with such scornefull pryde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had him abusde and shamed yesterday;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore, misdoubting least he should misguyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His former malice to some new assay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He cast to keepe him selfe so safely as he may.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>By this the other came in place likewise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And couching close his speare and all his powre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As bent to some malicious enterprise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He bad him stand t’abide the bitter stoure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his sore vengeaunce, or to make avoure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the lewd words and deedes which he had done:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With that ran at him, as he would devoure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His life attonce; who nought could do but shun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The perill of his pride, or else be over-run.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet he him still pursew’d from place to place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With full intent him cruelly to kill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And like a wilde goate round about did chace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Flying the fury of his bloudy will:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But his best succour and refuge was still</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behind his Ladies back; who to him cryde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And called oft with prayers loud and shrill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As ever he to Lady was affyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To spare her Knight, and rest with reason pacifyde:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But he the more thereby enraged was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with more eager felnesse him pursew’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that at length, after long weary chace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Having by chaunce a close advantage vew’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He over raught him, having long eschew’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His violence in vaine; and with his spere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Strooke through his shoulder, that the blood ensew’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In great aboundance, as a well it were</span>

				<p>
					<span>Like as a ship with dreadfull storme long tost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Having spent all her mastes and her ground-hold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now farre from harbour likely to be lost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At last some fisher-barke doth neare behold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That giveth comfort to her courage cold:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such was the state of this most courteous knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Being oppressed by that faytour bold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he remayned in most perilous plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And his sad Ladie left in pitifull affright:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Till that, by fortune passing all foresight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A salvage man, which in those woods did wonne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drawne with that Ladies loud and piteous shright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Toward the same incessantly did ronne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To understand what there was to be donne:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There he this most discourteous craven found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As fiercely yet as when he first begonne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Chasing the gentle Calepine around,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne sparing him the more for all his grievous wound.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The salvage man, that never till this houre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did taste of pittie, neither gentlesse knew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeing his sharpe assault and cruell stoure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was much emmoved at his perils vew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That even his ruder hart began to rew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And feele compassion of his evill plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against his foe that did him so pursew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From whom he meant to free him, if he might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And him avenge of that so villenous despight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet armes or weapon had he none to fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne knew the use of warlike instruments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Save such as sudden rage him lent to smite;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But naked, without needfull vestiments</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To clad his corpse with meete habiliments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He cared not for dint of sword nor speere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No more then for the stroke of strawes or bents:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For from his mothers wombe, which him did beare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was invulnerable made by Magicke leare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He stayed not t’advize which way were best</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His foe t’assayle, or how himselfe to gard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But with fierce fury and with force infest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon him ran; who being well prepard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His first assault full warily did ward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with the push of his sharp-pointed speare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full on the breast him strooke, so strong and hard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That forst him backe recoyle and reele areare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet in his bodie made no wound nor bloud appeare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that the wyld man more enraged grew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like to a Tygre that hath mist his pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with mad moode againe upon him flew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Regarding neither speare that mote him slay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor his fierce steed that mote him much dismay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The salvage nation doth all dread despize:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tho on his shield he griple hold did lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And held the same so hard, that by no wize</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He could him force to loose, or leave his enterprize.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Long did he wrest and wring it to and fro,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And every way did try, but all in vaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For he would not his greedie grype forgoe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But hayld and puld with all his might and maine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That from his steed him nigh he drew againe:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who having now no use of his long speare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So nigh at hand, nor force his shield to straine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both speare and shield, as things that needlesse were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He quite forsooke, and fled himselfe away for feare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But after him the wyld man ran apace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And him pursewed with importune speed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(For he was swift as any Bucke in chace)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, had he not in his extreamest need</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bene helped through the swiftnesse of his steed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He had him overtaken in his flight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, ever as he saw him nigh succeed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gan cry aloud with horrible affright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shrieked out, a thing uncomely for a knight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, when the Salvage saw his labour vaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In following of him that fled so fast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He wearie woxe, and backe return’d againe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With speede unto the place, whereas he last</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had left that couple nere their utmost cast:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There he that knight full sorely bleeding found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke the Ladie fearefully aghast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both for the perill of the present stound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And also for the sharpnesse of her rankling wound:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For though she were right glad so rid to bee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From that vile lozell which her late offended;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet now no lesse encombrance she did see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And perill, by this salvage man pretended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gainst whom she saw no meanes to be defended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By reason that her knight was wounded sore:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore her selfe she wholy recommended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To Gods sole grace, whom she did oft implore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To send her succour, being of all hope forlore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But the wyld man, contrarie to her feare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came to her creeping like a fawning hound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by rude tokens made to her appeare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His deepe compassion of her dolefull stound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Kissing his hands, and crouching to the ground;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For other language had he none, nor speach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But a soft murmure and confused sound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of senselesse words, which nature did him teach</span>
					<br/>
					<span>T’expresse his passions, which his reason did empeach.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And, comming likewise to the wounded knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When he beheld the streames of purple blood</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet flowing fresh, as moved with the sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He made great mone after his salvage mood;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, running streight into the thickest wood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A certaine herbe from thence unto him brought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose vertue he by use well understood;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The juyce whereof into his wound he wrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And stopt the bleeding straight, ere he it staunched thought.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then taking up that Recreants shield and speare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which earst he left, he signes unto them made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With him to wend unto his wonning neare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which he easily did them perswade.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Farre in the forrest, by a hollow glade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Covered with mossie shrubs, which spredding brode</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did underneath them make a gloomy shade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where foot of living creature never trode,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne scarse wyld beasts durst come, there was this wights abode.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thether he brought these unacquainted guests,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom faire semblance, as he could, he shewed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By signes, by lookes, and all his other gests;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But the bare ground with hoarie mosse bestrewed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Must be their bed; their pillow was unsowed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the frutes of the forrest was their feast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For their bad Stuard neither plough’d nor sowed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne fed on flesh, ne ever of wyld beast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did taste the bloud, obaying natures first beheast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet, howsoever base and meane it were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They tooke it well, and thanked God for all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which had them freed from that deadly feare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sav’d from being to that caytive thrall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here they of force (as fortune now did fall)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Compelled were themselves awhile to rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Glad of that easement, though it were but small;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That having there their wounds awhile redrest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They mote the abler be to passe unto the rest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>During which time that wyld man did apply</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His best endevour and his daily paine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In seeking all the woods both farre and nye</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For herbes to dresse their wounds; still seeming faine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When ought he did, that did their lyking gaine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So as ere long he had that knightes wound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Recured well, and made him whole againe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that same Ladies hurt no herbe he found</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which could redresse, for it was inwardly unsound.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now when as Calepine was woxen strong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon a day he cast abrode to wend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To take the ayre and heare the thrushes song,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unarm’d, as fearing neither foe nor frend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And without sword his person to defend:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There him befell, unlocked for before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An hard adventure with unhappie end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A cruell Beare, the which an infant bore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Betwixt his bloodie jawes, besprinckled all with gore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The litle babe did loudly scrike and squall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the woods with piteous plaints did fill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if his cry did meane for helpe to call</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To Calepine, whose eares those shrieches shrill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Percing his hart, with pities point did thrill;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That after him he ran with zealous haste</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To rescue th’ infant, ere he did him kill:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom though he saw now somewhat overpast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet by the cry he follow’d, and pursewed fast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Well then him chaunst his heavy armes to want,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose burden mote empeach his needfull speed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hinder him from libertie to pant;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For having long time, as his daily weed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Them wont to weare, and wend on foot for need,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now wanting them he felt himselfe so light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That like an Hauke, which feeling her selfe freed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From bels and jesses which did let her flight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Him seem’d his feet did fly and in their speed delight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So well he sped him, that the wearie Beare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere long he overtooke and forst to stay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And without weapon him assayling neare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Compeld him soone the spoyle adowne to lay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherewith the beast enrag’d to loose his pray</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon him turned, and, with greedie force</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And furie to be crossed in his way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gaping full wyde, did thinke without remorse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be aveng’d on him and to devoure his corse.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But the bold knight no whit thereat dismayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But catching up in hand a ragged stone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which lay thereby (so fortune him did ayde)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon him ran, and thrust it all attone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into his gaping throte, that made him grone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gaspe for breath, that he nigh choked was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Being unable to digest that bone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne could it upward come, nor downward passe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne could he brooke the coldnesse of the stony masse.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whom when as he thus combred did behold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stryving in vaine that nigh his bowels brast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He with him closd, and, laying mightie hold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon his throte, did gripe his gorge so fast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That wanting breath him downe to ground he cast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, then oppressing him with urgent paine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere long enforst to breath his utmost blast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gnashing his cruell teeth at him in vaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And threatning his sharpe clawes, now wanting powre to traine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then tooke he up betwixt his armes twaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The litle babe, sweet relickes of his pray;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom pitying to heare so sore complaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From his soft eyes the teares he wypt away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from his face the filth that did it ray;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And every litle limbe he searcht around,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And every part that under sweath-bands lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Least that the beasts sharpe teeth had any wound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Made in his tender flesh; but whole them all he found.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So, having all his bands againe uptyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He with him thought backe to returne againe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when he lookt about on every syde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To weet which way were best to entertaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To bring him to the place where he would faine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He could no path nor tract of foot descry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne by inquirie learne, nor ghesse by ayme;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For nought but woods and forrests farre and nye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That all about did close the compasse of his eye.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Much was he then encombred, ne could tell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which way to take: now West he went awhile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then North, then neither, but as fortune fell:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So up and downe he wandred many a mile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With weary travell and uncertaine toile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet nought the nearer to his journeys end;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And evermore his lovely litle spoile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Crying for food did greatly him offend:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So all that day in wandring vainely he did spend.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At last, about the setting of the Sunne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him selfe out of the forest he did wynd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by good fortune the plaine champion wonne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where, looking all about where he mote fynd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some place of succour to content his mynd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At length he heard under the forrests syde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A voice, that seemed of some woman kynd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which to her selfe lamenting loudly cryde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And oft complayn’d of fate, and fortune oft defyde.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To whom approching, when as she perceived</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A stranger wight in place, her plaint she stayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if she doubted to have bene deceived,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or loth to let her sorrowes be bewrayd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom when as Calepine saw so dismayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He to her drew, and with faire blandishment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her chearing up, thus gently to her sayd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“What be you, wofull Dame, which thus lament,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for what cause, declare; so mote ye not repent.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To whom she thus: “What need me, Sir, to tell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That which your selfe have earst ared so right?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A wofull dame ye have me termed well;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So much more wofull, as my wofull plight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cannot redressed be by living wight!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Nathlesse,” (quoth he) “if need doe not you bynd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doe it disclose to ease your grieved spright:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Oftimes it haps that sorrowes of the mynd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Find remedie unsought, which seeking cannot fynd.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then thus began the lamentable Dame:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Sith then ye needs will know the griefe I hoord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I am th’unfortunate Matilde by name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The wife of bold Sir Bruin, who is Lord</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all this land, late conquer’d by his sword</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From a great Gyant, called Cormoraunt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom he did overthrow by yonder foord;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in three battailes did so deadly daunt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he dare not returne for all his daily vaunt.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“So is my Lord now seiz’d of all the land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As in his fee, with peaceable estate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And quietly doth hold it in his hand,</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to these happie fortunes cruell fate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hath joyn’d one evill, which doth overthrow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All these our joyes, and all our blisse abate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And like in time to further ill to grow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all this land with endlesse losse to overflow.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“For th’ heavens, envying our prosperitie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have not vouchsaft to graunt unto us twaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The gladfull blessing of posteritie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which we might see after our selves remaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In th’ heritage of our unhappie paine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that for want of heires it to defend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All is in time like to returne againe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To that foule feend, who dayly doth attend</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To leape into the same after our lives end.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But most my Lord is grieved herewithall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And makes exceeding mone, when he does thinke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all this land unto his foe shall fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For which he long in vaine did sweate and swinke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That now the same he greatly doth forthinke.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet was it sayd, there should to him a sonne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be gotten, not begotten; which should drinke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And dry up all the water which doth ronne</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the next brooke, by whom that feend shold be fordonne.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Well hop’t he then, when this was propheside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That from his sides some noble chyld should rize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which through fame should farre be magnifide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this proud gyant should with brave emprize</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Quite overthrow; who now ginnes to despize</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The good Sir Bruin growing farre in yeares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who thinkes from me his sorrow all doth rize.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lo! this my cause of griefe to you appeares;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which I thus doe mourne, and poure forth ceaselesse teares.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when he heard, he inly touched was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With tender ruth for her unworthy griefe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, when he had devized of her case,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He gan in mind conceive a fit reliefe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For all her paine, if please her make the priefe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, having cheared her, thus said: “Faire Dame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In evils counsell is the comfort chiefe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which though I be not wise enough to frame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet, as I well it meane, vouchsafe it without blame.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“If that the cause of this your languishment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be lacke of children to supply your place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lo! how good fortune doth to you present</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This litle babe, of sweete and lovely face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And spotlesse spirit in which ye may enchace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whatever formes ye list thereto apply,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Being now soft and fit them to embrace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whether ye list him traine in chevalry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or noursle up in lore of learn’d Philosophy.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“And, certes, it hath oftentimes bene scene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That of the like, whose linage was unknowne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More brave and noble knights have raysed beene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(As their victorious deedes have often showen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Being with fame through many Nations blowen,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then those which have bene dandled in the lap:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore some thought that those brave imps were sowen</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here by the Gods, and fed with heavenly sap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That made them grow so high t’ all honorable hap.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Ladie, hearkning to his sensefull speach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Found nothing that he said unmeet nor geason,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Having oft scene it tryde as he did teach:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore inclyning to his goodly reason,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Agreeing well both with the place and season,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She gladly did of that same babe accept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As of her owne by liverey and seisin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, having over it a litle wept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She bore it thence, and ever as her owne it kept.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Right glad was Calepine to be so rid</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his young charge whereof he skilled nought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne she lesse glad; for she so wisely did,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with her husband under hand so wrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, when that infant unto him she brought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She made him think it surely was his owne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And it in goodly thewes so well upbrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it became a famous knight well knowne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And did right noble deedes; the which elswhere are showne.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Calepine, now being left alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under the greenewoods side in sorie plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Withouten armes or steede to ride upon,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Albe that Dame, by all the meanes she might,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And, for exceeding griefe which inly grew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he his love so lucklesse now had lost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On the cold ground maugre himselfe he threw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For fell despight to be so sorely crost;</span>

					<span>O what an easie thing is to descry</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The gentle bloud, how ever it be wrapt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In sad misfortunes foule deformity</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wretched sorrowes, which have often hapt!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For howsoever it may grow mis-shapt,</span>

					<span class="i1">Like this wyld man being undisciplynd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That to all vertue it may seeme unapt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet will it shew some sparkes of gentle mynd,</span>

					<span>And at the last breake forth in his owne proper kynd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>That plainely may in this wyld man be red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, though he were still in this desert wood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mongst salvage beasts both rudely borne and bred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ever saw faire guize, ne learned good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet shewd some token of his gentle blood</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By gentle usage of that wretched Dame:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For certes he was borne of noble blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How ever by hard hap he h ether came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As ye may know when time shall be to tell the same.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who, when as now long time he lacked had</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The good Sir Calepine, that farre was strayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did wexe exceeding sorrowfull and sad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he of some misfortune were afrayd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, leaving there this Ladie all dismayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Went forth streightway into the forrest wyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To seeke if he perchance asleep were layd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or what so else were unto him betyde:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sought him farre and neare, yet him no where he spyde.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tho, backe returning to that sorie Dame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He shewed semblant of exceeding mone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By speaking signes, as he them best could frame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now wringing both his wretched hands in one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now beating his hard head upon a stone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ruth it was to see him so lament:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By which she well perceiving what was done,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gan teare her hayre, and all her garments rent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And beat her breast, and piteously her selfe torment.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Upon the ground her selfe she fiercely threw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Regardlesse of her wounds yet bleeding rife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with their bloud did all the flore imbrew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if her breast, new launcht with murdrous knife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would streight dislodge the wretched wearie life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There she long groveling and deepe groning lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if her vitall powers were at strife</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With stronger death, and feared their decay:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such were this Ladies pangs and dolorous assay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whom when the Salvage saw so sore distrest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He reared her up from the bloudie ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sought by all the meanes that he could best</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her to recure out of that stony swound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And staunch the bleeding of her dreary wound:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet nould she be recomforted for nought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor cease her sorrow and impatient stound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But day and night did vexe her carefull thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ever more and more her owne affliction wrought.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At length, when as no hope of his retourne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She saw now left, she cast to leave the place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wend abrode, though feeble and forlorne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To seeke some comfort in that sorie case.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His steede, now strong through rest so long a space,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well as she could she got, and did bedight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And being thereon mounted forth did pace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Withouten guide her to condudt aright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or gard her to defend from bold oppressors might.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whom when her Host saw readie to depart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He would not suffer her alone to fare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But gan himselfe addresse to take her part.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those warlike armes which Calepine whyleare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had left behind he gan eftsoones prepare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And put them all about himselfe unfit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His shield, his helmet, and his curats bare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But without sword upon his thigh to sit:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sir Calepine himselfe away had hidden it.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So forth they traveld, an uneven payre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That mote to all men seeme an uncouth sight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A salvage man matcht with a Ladie fayre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That rather seem’d the conquest of his might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gotten by spoyle then purchaced aright:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he did her attend most carefully,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And faithfully did serve both day and night</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Withouten thought of shame or villeny,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne ever shewed signe of foule disloyalty.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Upon a day, as on their way they went,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It chaunst some furniture about her steed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be disordred by some accident,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which to redresse she did th’assistance need</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of this her groome; which he by signes did reede,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And streight his combrous armes aside did lay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the ground withouten doubt or dreed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in his homely wize began to assay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>T’amend what was amisse, and put in right aray.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Bout which whilest he was busied thus hard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lo! where a knight, together with his squire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All arm’d to point came ryding thetherward;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which seemed, by their portance and attire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be two errant knights, that did inquire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After adventures, where they mote them get.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those were to weet (if that ye it require)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Prince Arthur and young Timias, which met</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By straunge occasion that here needs forth be set.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>After that Timias had againe recured</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The favour of Belphebe (as ye heard)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of her grace did stand againe assured,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To happie blisse he was full high uprear’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nether of envy nor of chaunge afeard:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Though many foes did him maligne therefore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with unjust detraction him did beard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet he himselfe so well and wisely bore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in her soveraine lyking he dwelt evermore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But of them all which did his ruine seeke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Three mightie enemies did him most despight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Three mightie ones, and cruell minded eeke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That him not onely sought by open might</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To overthrow, but to supplant by slight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The first of them by name was cald Despetto,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Exceeding all the rest in powre and hight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The second, not so strong but wise, Decetto;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The third, nor strong nor wise, but spightfullest, Defetto.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Oftimes their sundry powres they did employ,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And several deceipts, but all in vaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For neither they by force could him destroy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne yet entrap in treasons subtill traine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore, conspiring all together plaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They did their counsels now in one compound:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where singled forces faile, conjoynd may gaine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Blatant Beast the fittest meanes they found</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To worke his utter shame, and throughly him confound.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Upon a day, as they the time did waite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When he did raunge the wood for salvage game,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They sent that Blatant Beast to be a baite</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To draw him from his deare beloved dame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unwares into the daunger of defame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For well they wist that Squire to be so bold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That no one beast in forrest, wylde or tame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Met him in chase but he it challenge would,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And plucke the pray oftimes out of their greedy hould.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The hardy boy, as they devised had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeing the ugly Monster passing by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon him set, of perill nought adrad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne skilfull of the uncouth jeopardy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And charged him so fierce and furiously,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That his great force unable to endure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He forced was to turne from him and fly:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet ere he fled he with his tooth impure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Him heedlesse bit, the whiles he was thereof secure.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Securely he did after him pursew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thinking by speed to overtake his flight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who through thicke woods and brakes and briers him drew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To weary him the more and waste his spight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that he now has almost spent his spright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till that at length unto a woody glade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He came, whose covert stopt his further sight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There his three foes shrowded in guilefull shade</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of their ambush broke, and gan him to invade.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sharpely they all attonce did him assaile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Burning with inward rancour and despight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And heaped strokes did round about him haile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With so huge force, that seemed nothing might</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beare off their blowes from percing thorough quite:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet he them all so warily did ward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That none of them in his soft flesh did bite;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the while his backe for best safegard</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He lent against a tree, that backeward onset bard.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like a wylde Bull, that, being at a bay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is bayted of a mastiffe and a hound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And a curre-dog, that doe him sharpe assay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On every side, and beat about him round;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But most that curre, barking with bitter sownd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And creeping still behinde, doth him incomber,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in his chauffe he digs the trampled ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And threats his horns, and bellowes like the thonder</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So did that Squire his foes disperse and drive asonder.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Him well behoved so; for his three foes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sought to encompasse him on every side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And dangerously did round about enclose:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But most of all Defetto him annoyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Creeping behinde him still to have destroyde;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So did Decetto eke him circumvent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But stout Despetto in his greater pryde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did front him, face to face against him bent:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet he them all withstood, and often made relent.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Till that at length, nigh tyrd with former chace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And weary now with carefull keeping ward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He gan to shrinke and somewhat to give place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full like ere long to have escaped hard;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When as unwares he in the forrest heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A trampling steede, that with his neighing fast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did warne his rider be uppon his gard;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With noise whereof the Squire, now nigh aghast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Revived was, and sad dispaire away did cast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Eftsoones he spide a Knight approching nye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, seeing one in so great daunger set</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mongst many foes, him selfe did faster hye</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To reskue him, and his weake part abet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For pitty so to see him overset:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom soone as his three enemies did vew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They fled, and fast into the wood did get.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him booted not to thinke them to pursew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The covert was so thicke that did no passage shew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then turning to that swaine him well he knew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be his Timias, his owne true Squire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereof exceeding glad he to him drew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, him embracing twixt his armes entire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him thus bespake: “My liefe, my lifes desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Why have ye me alone thus long yleft?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tell me what worlds despight, or heavens yre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hath you thus long away from me bereft?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where have ye all this while bin wandring, where bene weft?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that he sighed deepe for inward tyne:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom the Squire nought aunswered againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, shedding few soft teares from tender eyne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His dear affect with silence did restraine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And shut up all his plaint in privy paine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There they awhile some gracious speaches spent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As to them seemed fit time to entertaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After all which up to their steedes they went,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forth together rode, a comely couplement.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So now they be arrived both in sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of this wyld man, whom they full busie found</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">About the sad Serena things to dight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With those brave armours lying on the ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That seem’d the spoile of some right well renownd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which when that Squire beheld, he to them stept</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thinking to take them from that hylding hound;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he it seeing lightly to him lept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sternely with strong hand it from his handling kept.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Gnashing his grinded teeth with griesly looke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sparkling fire out of his furious eyne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him with his fist unwares on th’ head he strooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That made him downe unto the earth encline;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence soone upstarting much he gan repine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And laying hand upon his wrathfull blade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thought therewithall forthwith him to have slaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who it perceiving hand upon him layd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And greedily him griping his avengement stayd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that aloude the faire Serena cryde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the Knight, them to dispart in twaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who to them stepping did them soone divide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And did from further violence restraine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Albe the wyld-man hardly would refraine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then gan the Prince of her for to demand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What and from whence she was, and by what traine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She fell into that salvage villaines hand?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And whether free with him she now were, or in band?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To whom she thus: “I am, as now ye see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The wretchedst Dame that lives this day on ground;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who both in minde, the which most grieveth me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And body have receiv’d a mortall wound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That hath me driven to this drery stound.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I was erewhile the love of Calepine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who whether he alive be to be found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or by some deadly chaunce be done to pine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since I him lately lost, uneath is to define.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“In salvage forrest I him lost of late,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where I had surely long ere this bene dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or else remained in most wretched state,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had not this wylde man in that wofull stead</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Kept and delivered me from deadly dread.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In such a salvage wight, of brutish kynd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Amongst wilde beastes in desert forrests bred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It is most straunge and wonderfull to fynd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So milde humanity and perfect gentle mynd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Let me therefore this favour for him finde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ye will not your wrath upon him wreake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sith he cannot expresse his simple mmde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne yours conceive, ne but by tokens speake:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Small praise to prove your powre on wight so weake.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With such faire words she did their heat asswage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the strong course of their displeasure breake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That they to pitty turnd their former rage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And each sought to supply the office of her page.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So having all things well about her dight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She on her way cast forward to proceede,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And they her forth conducted, where they might</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Finde harbour fit to comfort her great neede;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For now her wounds corruption gan to breed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke this Squire, who likewise wounded was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that same Monster late, for lacke of heed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now gan to faint, and further could not pas</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through feeblenesse, which all his limbes oppressed has.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So forth they rode together all in troupe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To seeke some place the which mote yeeld some ease</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To these sicke twaine, that now began to droupe:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the way the Prince sought to appease</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The bitter anguish of their sharpe disease</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By all the courteous meanes he could invent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Somewhile with merry purpose, fit to please,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And otherwhile with good encouragement</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make them to endure the pains did them torment.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Mongst which Serena did to him relate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The foule discourt’sies and unknightly parts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which Turpine had unto her shewed late,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without compassion of her cruell smarts:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Although Blandina did with all her arts</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him otherwise perswade all that she might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet he of malice, without her desarts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not onely her excluded late at night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But also trayterously did wound her weary Knight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Wherewith the Prince sore moved there avoud</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That soone as he returned backe againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He would avenge th’abuses of that proud</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And shamefull Knight of whom she did complaine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This wize did they each other entertaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To passe the tedious travell of the way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till towards night they came unto a plaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By which a little Hermitage there lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Far from all neighbourhood the which annoy itonay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And nigh thereto a little Chappell stoode,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which being all with Yvy overspred</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Deckt all the roofe, and, shadowing the roode,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seem’d like a grove faire braunched over-hed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therein the Hermite, which his life here led</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In streight observaunce of religious vow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was wont his howres and holy things to bed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And therein he likewise was praying now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whenas these Knights arriv’d, they wist not where nor how.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They stayd not there, but streightway in did pas:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom when the Hermite present saw in place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From his devotion streight he troubled was;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which breaking off he toward them did pace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With stayed steps and grave beseeming grace:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For well it seem’d that whilome he had beene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some goodly person, and of gentle race,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That could his good to all; and well did weene</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How each to entertaine with curt’sie well beseene.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And soothly it was sayd by common fame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So long as age enabled him thereto,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he had bene a man of mickle name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Renowmed much in armes and derring doe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But being aged now, and weary to</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of warres delight and worlds contentious toyle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The name of knighthood he did disavow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, hanging up his armes and warlike spoyle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From all this worlds incombraunce did himselfe assoyle.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He thence them led into his Hermitage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Letting their steedes to graze upon the greene.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Small was his house, and like a little cage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For his owne turne, yet inly neate and clene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Deckt with greene boughes and flowers gay beseene:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therein he them full faire did entertaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not with such forged showes, as fitter beene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For courting fooles that curtesies would faine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But with entire affection and appearaunce plaine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet was their fare but homely, such as hee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did use his feeble body to sustaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which full gladly they did take in gree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such as it was, ne did of want complaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But being well suffiz’d them rested faine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But fair Serene all night could take no rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne yet that gentle Squire, for grievous paine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of their late woundes, the which the Blatant Beast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had given them, whose griefe through suffraunce sore increast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So all that night they past in great disease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till that the morning, bringing earely light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To guide mens labours, brought them also ease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And some asswagement of their painefull plight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then up they rose, and gan them selves to dight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto their journey; but that Squire and Dame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So faint and feeble were, that they ne might</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Endure to travell, nor one foote to frame:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their hearts were sicke; their sides were sore; their feete were lame.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Therefore the Prince, whom great affaires in mynd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would not permit to make there lenger stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was forced there to leave them both behynd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In that good Hermits charge; whom he did pray</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To tend them well. So forth he went his way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with him eke the salvage, (that whyleare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeing his royall usage and array</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was greatly growne in love of that brave pere,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would rteedes depart; as shall declared be elsewhere.</span>

					<span>No wound, which warlike hand of enemy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Inflicts with dint of sword, so sore doth light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As doth the poysnous sting, which infamy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Infixeth in the name of noble wight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For by no art, nor any leaches might,</span>

					<span class="i1">Of Podalyrius did in it retaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can remedy such hurts: such hurts are hellish paine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Such were the wounds the which that Blatant Beast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made in the bodies of that Squire and Dame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, being such, were now much more increast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For want of taking heede unto the same,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That now corrupt and curelesse they became:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Howbe that carefull Hermite did his best,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With many kindes of medicines meete, to tame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The poysnous humour which did most infest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their ranckling wounds, and every day them duely drest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For he right well in Leaches craft was scene;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And through the long experience of his dayes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which had in many fortunes tossed beene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And past through many perillous assayes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He knew the diverse went of mortall wayes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in the mindes of men had great insight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which with sage counsell, when they went astray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He could enforme, and them reduce aright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the passions heale which wound the weaker spright.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For whylome he had bene a doughty Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As any one that lived in his daies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And proved oft in many perillous fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which he grace and glory wonne alwaies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in all battels bore away the baies:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But being now attacht with timely age,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And weary of this worlds unquiet waies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He tooke him selfe unto this Hermitage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which he liv’d alone, like carelesse bird in cage.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One day, as he was searching of their wounds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He found that they had festred privily;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ranckling inward with unruly stounds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The inner parts now gan to putrify,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That quite they seem’d past helpe of surgery;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And rather needed to be disciplinde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With holesome reede of sad sobriety,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To rule the stubborne rage of passion blinde:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Give salves to every sore, but counsell to the minde.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So, taking them apart into his cell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He to that point fit speaches gan to frame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he the art of words knew wondrous well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke could doe as well as say the same;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thus he to them sayd: “Faire daughter Dame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And you, faire Sonne, which here thus long now lie</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In piteous languor since ye hither came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In vaine of me ye hope for remedie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I likewise in vaine doe salves to you applie:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“For in your selfe your onely helpe doth lie</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To heale your selves, and must proceed alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From your owne will to cure your maladie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who can him cure that will be cur’d of none?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If therefore health ye seeke, observe this one:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">First learne your outward senses to refraine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From things that stirre up fraile affection;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Your eies, your eares, your tongue, your talk restraine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From that they most affect, and in due termes containe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“For from those outward sences, ill affected,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The seede of all this evill first doth spring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which at the first, before it had infected,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mote easie be supprest with little thing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But being growen strong it forth doth bring</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sorrow, and anguish, and impatient paine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In th’inner parts; and lastly, scattering</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Contagious poyson close through every vaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It never rests till it have wrought his finall bane.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“For that beastes teeth, which wounded you tofore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are so exceeding venemous and keene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made all of rusty yron ranckling sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That where they bite it booteth not to weene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With salve, or antidote, or other mene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It ever to amend: ne marvaile ought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For that same beast was bred of hellish strene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And long in darksome Stygian den upbrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Begot of foule Echidna, as in bookes is taught.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Echidna is a Monster direfull dred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom Gods doe hate, and heavens abhor to see;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So hideous is her shape, so huge her hed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That even the hellish fiends affrighted bee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At sight thereof, and from her presence flee:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet did her face and former parts professe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A faire young Mayden, full of comely glee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But all her hinder parts did plaine expresse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A monstrous Dragon, full of fearefull uglinesse.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“To her the Gods, for her so dreadfull face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In fearefull darkenesse, furthest from the skie</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from the earth, appointed have her place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mongst rocks and caves, where she enrold doth lie</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In hideous horrour and obscurity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wasting the strength of her immortall age:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There did Typhaon with her company;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cruell Typhaon, whose tempestuous rage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Makes th’ heavens tremble oft, and him with vowes asswage.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Of that commixtion they did then beget</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This hellish Dog, that hight the Blatant Beast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A wicked Monster, that his tongue doth whet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gainst all, both good and bad, both most and least,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And pours his poysnous gall forth to infest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The noblest wights with notable defame:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ever Knight that bore so lofty creast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ever Lady of so honest name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he them spotted with reproch, or secrete shame.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“In vaine therefore it were with medicine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To goe about to salve such kynd of sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That rather needes wise read and discipline,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then outward salves that may augment it more.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Aye me!” (sayd then Serena, sighing sore)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“What hope of helpe doth then for us remaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If that no salves may us to health restore?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“But sith we need good counsell,” (sayd the swaine)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Aread, good Sire, some counsell that may us sustaine.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The best” (sayd he) “that I can you advize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is to avoide the occasion of the ill:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For when the cause, whence evill doth arize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Removed is, th’effecl surceaseth still.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Abstaine from pleasure, and restraine your will;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Subdue desire, and bridle loose delight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Use scanted diet, and forbeare your fill;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shun secresie, and talke in open sight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So shall you soone repaire your present evill plight.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus having sayd, his sickely patients</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did gladly hearken to his grave beheast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And kept so well his wise commaundements,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in short space their malady was ceast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke the biting of that harmefull Beast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was throughly heal’d. Tho when they did perceave</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their wounds recur’d, and forces reincreast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that good Hermite both they tooke their leave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And went both on their way, ne ech would other leave:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But each the other vow’d t’accompany:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Lady, for that she was much in dred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now left alone in great extremity;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Squire, for that he courteous was indeed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would not her leave alone in her great need.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So both together traveld, till they met</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With a faire Mayden clad in mourning weed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon a mangy jade unmeetely set,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And a lewd foole her leading thorough dry and wet.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But by what meanes that shame to her befell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And how thereof her selfe she did acquite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I must awhile forbeare to you to tell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till that, as comes by course, I doe recite</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What fortune to the Briton Prince did lite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pursuing that proud Knight, the which whileare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wrought to Sir Calepine so foule despight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke his Lady, though she sickely were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So lewdly had abusde, as ye did lately heare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Prince, according to the former token</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which faire Serene to him delivered had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pursu’d him streight; in mynd to bene ywroken</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all the vile demeane and usage bad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which he had those two so ill bestad:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne wight with him on that adventure went,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that wylde man; whom though he oft forbad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet for no bidding, nor for being shent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would he restrayned be from his attendement.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Arriving there, as did by chaunce befall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He found the gate wydc ope, and in he rode,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne stayd, till that he came into \he hall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where soft dismounting, like a weary lode,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the ground with feeble feete he trode,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he unable were for very neede</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To move one foote, but there must make abode:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whiles the salvage man did take his steede,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in some stable neare did set him up to feede.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ere long to him a homely groome there came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in rude wise him asked, what he was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That durst so boldly, without let or shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into his Lords forbidden hall to passe?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom the Prince, him fayning to embase,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mylde answer made, he was an errant Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which was fall’n into this feeble case</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through many wounds, which lately he in fight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Received had, and prayd to pitty his ill plight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But he, the more outrageous and bold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sternely did bid him quickely thence avaunt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or deare aby; for-why his Lord of old</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did hate all errant Knights which there did haunt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne lodging would to any of them graunt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And therefore lightly bad him packe away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not sparing him with bitter words to taunt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And therewithall rude hand on him did lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To thrust him out of dore doing his worst assay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when the Salvage, comming now in place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beheld, eftsoones he all enraged grew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, running streight upon that villaine base,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like a fell Lion at him fiercely flew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with his teeth and nailes, in present vew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him rudely rent and all to peeces tore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So miserably him all helpelesse slew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with the noise, whilest he did loudly rore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The people of the house rose forth in great uprore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who when on ground they saw their fellow slaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that same Knight and Salvage standing by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon them two they fell with might and maine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on them layd so huge and horribly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if they would have slaine them presently:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But the bold Prince defended him so well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And their assault withstood so mightily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, maugre all their might, he did repell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And beat them back, whilest many underneath him fell.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet he them still so sharpely did pursew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That few of them he left alive, which fled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those evill tidings to their Lord to shew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, hearing how his people badly sped,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came forth in hast; where, when as with the dead</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He saw the ground all strow’d, and that same Knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And salvage with their bloud fresh steeming red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He woxe nigh mad with wrath and fell despight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with reprochfull words him thus bespake on hight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Art thou he, traytor, that with treason vile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hast slaine my men in this unmanly maner,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now triumphest in the piteous spoile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of these poore folk, whose soules with black dishonor</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And foule defame doe decke thy bloudy baner?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The meede whereof shall shortly be thy shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wretched end which still attendeth on her.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With that him selfe to battell he did frame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So did his forty yeomen, which there with him came.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With dreadfull force they all did him assaile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And round about with boystrous strokes oppresse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That on his shield did rattle like to haile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In a great tempest; that in such distresse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He wist not to which side him to addresse:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And evermore that craven cowherd Knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was at his backe with heartlesse heedinesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wayting if he un wares him murther might;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For cowardize doth still in villany delight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whereof whenas the Prince was well aware,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He to him turnd with furious intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And him against his powre gan to prepare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like a fierce Bull, that being busie bent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To fight with many foes about him ment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Feeling some curre behinde his heeles to bite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turnes him about with fell avengement:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So likewise turnde the Prince upon the Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And layd at him amaine with all his will and might.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who, when he once his dreadfull strokes had tasted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Durst not the furie of his force abyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But turn’d abacke, and to retyre him hasted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through the thick prease, there thinking him to hyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, when the Prince had once him plainely eyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He foot by foot him followed alway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne would him suffer once to shrinke asyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But joyning close huge lode at him did lay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who flying still did ward, and warding fly away.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, when his foe he still so eager saw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto his heeles himselfe he did betake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hoping unto some refuge to withdraw:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne would the Prince him ever foot forsake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where so he went, but after him did make.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He fled from roome to roome, from place to place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whylest every joynt for dread of death did quake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still looking after him that did him chace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That made him evermore increase his speedie pace.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At last he up into the chamber came</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereas his love was sitting all alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wayting what tydings of her folke became.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There did the Prince him overtake anone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Crying in vaine to her him to bemone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with his sword him on the head did smyte,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That to the ground he fell in senselesse swone:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet, whether thwart or flatly it did lyte,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tempred steele did not into his braynepan byte.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when the Ladie saw, with great affright</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She starting up began to shrieke aloud;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with her garment covering him from sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seem’d under her protection him to shroud;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And falling lowly at his feet her bowd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon her knee, intreating him for grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And often him besought, and prayd, and vowd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with the ruth of her so wretched case,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He stayd his second strooke, and did his hand abase.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Her weed she then withdrawing did him discover;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who now come to himselfe yet would not rize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But still did lie as dead, and quake, and quiver,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That even the Prince his basenesse did despize;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke his Dame, him seeing in such guize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gan him recomfort and from ground to reare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who rising up at last in ghastly wize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like troubled ghost, did dreadfully appeare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As one that had no life him left through former feare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whom when the Prince so deadly saw dismayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He for such basenesse shamefully him shent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with sharpe words did bitterly upbrayd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Vile cowheard dogge! now doe I much repent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ever I this life unto thee lent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereof thou, caytive, so unworthie art,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That both thy love, for lacke of hardiment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke thy selfe, for want of manly hart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke all knights hast shamed with this knightlesse part.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Yet further hast thou heaped shame to shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And crime to crime, by this thy cowheard feare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For first, it was to thee reprochfull blame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To erect this wicked custome, which I heare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gainst errant Knights and Ladies thou dost reare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom when thou mayst thou dost of arms despoile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or of their upper garment which they weare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet doest thou not with manhood, but with guile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maintaine this evil use, thy foes thereby to foile.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“And lastly, in approvance of thy wrong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To shew such faintnesse and foule cowardize</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is greatest shame; for oft it falles, that strong</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And valiant Knights doe rashly enterprize</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Either for fame, or else for exercize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A wrongfull quarrell to maintaine by fight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet have through prowesse and their brave emprize</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gotten great worship in this worldes sight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For greater force there needs to maintaine wrong then right.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Yet, since thy life unto this Ladie fayre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I given have, live in reproch and scorne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ever armes ne ever knighthood dare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hence to professe; for shame is to adorne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With so brave badges one so basely borne:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But onely breath, sith that I did forgive.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So having from his craven bodie torne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those goodly armes, he them away did give,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And onely suffred him this wretched life to live.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There whilest he thus was setling things above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Atwene that Ladie myld and recreant knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom his life he graunted for her love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He gan bethinke him in what perilous plight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He had behynd him left that salvage wight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Amongst so many foes, whom sure he thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By this quite slaine in so unequall fight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore descending backe in haste he sought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If yet he were alive, or to destruction brought.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There he him found environed about</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With slaughtred bodies which his hand had slaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And laying yet afresh, with courage stout,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the rest that did alive remaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom he likewise right sorely did constraine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like scattred sheepe, to seeke for safetie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After he gotten had with busie paine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some of their weapons which thereby did lie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With which he layd about, and made them fast to flie.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whom when the Prince so felly saw to rage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Approching to him neare, his hand he stayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sought by making signes him to asswage;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who them perceiving streight to him obayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As to his Lord, and downe his weapons layd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if he long had to his heasts bene trayned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thence he him brought away, and up convayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the chamber, where that Dame remayned</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With her unworthy knight, who ill him entertayned.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whom when the Salvage saw from daunger free,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sitting beside his Ladie there at ease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He well remembred that the same was hee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which lately sought his Lord for to displease:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tho all in rage he on him streight did seaze,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if he would in peeces him have rent:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, were not that the Prince did him appeaze,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He had not left one limbe of him unrent:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But streight he held his hand at his commaundement.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus having all things well in peace ordayned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Prince himselfe there all that night did rest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where him Blandina fayrely entertayned</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With all the courteous glee and goodly feast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which for him she could imagine best:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For well she knew the wayes to win good will</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of every wight, that were not too infest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And how to please the minds of good and ill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through tempering of her words and lookes by wondrous skill.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet were her words and lookes but false and fayned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To some hid end to make more easie way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or to allure such fondlings whom she trayned</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into her trap unto their owne decay:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereto, when needed, she could weepe and pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And when her listed she could fawne and flatter;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now smyling smoothly, like to sommers day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now glooming sadly, so to cloke her matter;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet were her words but wynd, and all her teares but water.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whether such grace were given her by kynd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As women wont their guilefull wits to guyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or learn’d the art to please, I doe not fynd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This well I wote, that she so well applyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her pleasing tongue, that soone she pacifyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The wrathfull Prince, and wrought her husbands peace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who nathelesse, not therewith satisfyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His rancorous despight did not releasse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne secretly from thought of fell revenge surceasse:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For all that night, the whyles the Prince did rest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In carelesse couch, not weeting what was ment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He watcht in close awayt with weapons prest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Willing to worke his villenous intent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On him that had so shamefully him shent:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet durst he not for very cowardize</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Effect the same, whylest all the night was spent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The morrow next the Prince did early rize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And passed forth to follow his first enterprize.</span>

					<span>Like as the gentle hart it selfe bewrayes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In doing gentle deedes with franke delight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even so the baser mind it selfe displayes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In cancred malice and revengefull spight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For to maligne, t’envie, t’use shifting slight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be arguments of a vile donghill mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which, what it dare not doe by open might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To worke by wicked treason wayes doth find,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By such discourteous deeds discovering his base kind.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>That well appears in this discourteous knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The coward Turpine, whereof now I treat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who notwithstanding that in former’ fight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He of the Prince his life received late,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet in his mind, malitious and ingrate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He gan devize to be aveng’d anew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For all that shame, which kindled inward hate:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore, so soone as he was out of vew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Himselfe in hast he arm’d, and did him fast pursew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Well did he tracl his steps as he did ryde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet would not neare approch in daungers eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But kept aloofe for dread to be descry de,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Untill fit time and place he mote espy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where he mote worke him scath and villeny.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At last he met two knights to him unknowne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which were armed both agreeably,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And both combynd, whatever chaunce were blowne</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Betwixt them to divide, and each to make his owne.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To whom false Turpine comming courteously,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To cloke the mischiefe which he inly ment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gan to complaine of great discourtesie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which a straunge knight, that neare afore him went,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had doen to him, and his deare Ladie shent:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which if they would afford him ayde at need</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For to avenge in time convenient,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They should accomplish both a knightly deed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for their paines obtaine of him a goodly meed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The knights beleev’d that all he sayd was trew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And being fresh and full of youthly spright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were glad to heare of that adventure new,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which they mote make triall of their might</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which never yet they had approved in fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke desirous of the offred meed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said then the one of them; “Where is that wight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which hath doen to thee this wrongfull deed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That we may it avenge, and punish him with speed?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“He rides” (said Turpine) “there not farre afore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With a wyld man soft footing by his syde;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, if ye list to haste a litle more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ye may him overtake in timely tyde.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eftsoones they pricked forth with forward pryde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, ere that litle while they ridden had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The gentle Prince not farre away they spyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ryding a softly pace with portance sad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Devizing of his love more then of daunger drad.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then one of them aloud unto him cryde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bidding him turne againe, false traytour knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Foule woman-wronger, for he him defyde.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With that they both at once with equall spight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did bend their speares, and both with equall might</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against him ran; but th’one did misse his marke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And being carried with his force forthright</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Glaunst swiftly by; like to that heavenly sparke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which glyding through the ayre lights all the heavens darke.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But th’other, ayming better, did him smite</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full in the shield with so impetuous powre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all his launce in peeces shivered quite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And scattered all about fell on the flowre:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But the stout Prince, with much more steddy stowre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full on his bever did him strike so sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the cold steele, through piercing, did devowre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His vitall breath, and to the ground him bore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where still he bathed lay in his owne bloody gore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As when a cast of Faulcons make their flight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At an Herneshaw, that lyes aloft on wing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whyles they strike at him with heedlesse might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The wane foule his bill doth backward wring;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On which the first, whose force her first doth bring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her selfe quite through the bodie doth engore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And falleth downe to ground like senselesse thing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But th’other, not so swift as she before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fayles of her souse, and passing by doth hurt no more.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>By this the other, which was passed by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Himselfe recovering was return’d to fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where when he saw his fellow lifelesse ly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He much was daunted with so dismall sight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet, nought abating of his former spight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let drive at him with so malitious mynd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if he would have passed through him quight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But the steele-head no stedfast hold could fynd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But glauncing by deceiv’d him of that he desynd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Not so the Prince; for his well-learned speare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tooke surer hould, and from his horses backe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above a launces length him forth did beare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gainst the cold hard earth so sore him strake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all his bones in peeces nigh he brake.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where seeing him so lie, he left his steed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to him leaping vengeance thought to take</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of him for all his former follies meed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With flaming sword in hand his terror more to breed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The fearfull swayne beholding: death so nie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cryde out aloud for mercie, him to save;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In lieu whereof he would to him descrie</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Great treason to him meant, his life to reave.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Prince soone hearkned, and his life forgave.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then thus said he: “There is a straunger knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which, for promise of great meed, us drave</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To this attempt to wreake his hid despight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that himselfe thereto did want sufficient might.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Prince much mused at such villenie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sayd: “Now sure ye well have earn’d your meed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For th’one is dead, and th’other soone shall die,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unlesse to me thou hether bring with speed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The wretch that hyr’d you to this wicked deed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He glad of life, and willing eke to wreake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The guilt on him which did this mischiefe breed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Swore by his sword, that neither day nor weeke</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would surceasse, but him where so he were would seeke.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So up he rose, and forth streightway he went</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Backe to the place where Turpine late he lore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There he him found in great astonishment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see him so bedight with bloodie gore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And griesly wounds that him appalled sore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet thus at length he said: “How now, Sir knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What meaneth this which here I see before?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How fortuneth this foule uncomely plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So different from that which earst ye seem’d in sight?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Perdie,” (said he) “in evill hourc it fell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ever I for meed did undertake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So hard a taske as life for hyre to sell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which I earst adventur’d for your sake:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Witnesse the wounds, and this wyde bloudie lake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which ye may see yet all about me steeme.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore now yeeld, as ye did promise make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My due reward, the which right well I deeme</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I yearned have, that life so dearely did redeeme.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But where then is” (quoth he halfe wrothfully)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Where is the bootie, which therefore I bought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That cursed caytive, my strong enemy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That recreant knight, whose hated life I sought?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And where is eke your friend which halfe it ought?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“He lyes” (said he) “upon the cold bare ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Slayne of that errant knight with whom he fought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom afterwards my selfe with many a wound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did slay againe, as ye may see there in the stound.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thereof false Turpin was full glad and faine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And needs with him streight to the place would ryde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where he himselfe might see his foeman slaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For else his feare could not be satisfyde.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So as they rode he saw the way all dyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With streames of bloud; which tracking by the traile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere long they came, whereas in evill tyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That other swayne, like ashes deadly pale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lay in the lap of death, rewing his wretched bale.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Much did the Craven seeme to mone his case,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That for his sake his deare life had forgone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, him bewayling with affection base,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did counterfeit kind pittie where was none:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For wheres no courage, theres no ruth nor mone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thence passing forth, not farre away he found</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereas the Prince himselfe lay all alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Loosely displayd upon the grassie ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Possessed of sweete sleepe that luld him soft in swound.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Wearie of travell in his former fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He there in shade himselfe had layd to rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Having his armes and warlike things undight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fearelesse of foes that mote his peace molest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whyles his salvage page, that wont be prest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was wandred in the wood another way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To doe some thing that seemed to him best;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whyles his Lord in silver slomber lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like to the Evening starre adorn’d with deawy ray.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whom when as Turpin saw so loosely layd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He weened well that he in deed was dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like as that other knight to him had sayd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, when he nigh approcht, he mote aread</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Plaine signes in him of life and livelihead:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat, much griev’d against that straunger knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That him too light of credence did mislead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He would have backe retyred from that sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That was to him on earth the deadliest despight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But that same knight would not once let him start,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But plainely gan to him declare the case</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all his mischiefe and late lucklesse smart;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How both he and his fellow there in place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were vanquished, and put to foule disgrace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And how that he, in lieu of life him lent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had vow’d unto the victor him to trace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And follow through the world where so he went,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till that he him delivered to his punishment.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He, therewith much abashed and affrayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began to tremble every limbe and vaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, softly whispering him, entyrely prayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">T’advize him better then by such a traine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him to betray unto a straunger swaine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet rather counseld him contrarywize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sith he likewise did wrong by him sustaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To joyne with him and vengeance to devize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whylest time did offer meanes him sleeping to surprize.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nathelesse, for all his speach the gentle knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would not be tempted to such villenie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Regarding more his faith which he did plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All were it to his mortall enemie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then to entrap him by false treacherie:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Great shame in lieges blood to be embrew’d!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus whylest they were debating diverslie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Salvage forth out of the wood issew’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Backe to the place, whereas his Lord he sleeping vew’d.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There when he saw those two so neare him stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He doubted much what mote their meaning bee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And throwing downe his load out of his hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(To weet, great store of forrest frute which hee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had for his food late gathered from the tree,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Himselfe unto his weapon he betooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That was an oaken plant, which lately hee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rent by the root; which he so sternely shooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That like an hazell wand it quivered and quooke.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whereat the Prince awaking, when he spyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The traytour Turpin with that other knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He started up; and snatching neare his syde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His trustie sword, the servant of his might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like a fell Lyon leaped to him light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And his left hand upon his collar layd.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therewith the cowheard, deaded with affright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fell flat to ground, ne word unto him sayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, holding up his hands, with silence mercie prayd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But he so full of indignation was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That to his prayer nought he would incline,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, as he lay upon the humbled gras,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His foot he set on his vile necke, in signe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of servile yoke, that nobler harts repine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then, letting him arise like abject thrall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He gan to him objecl his haynous crime,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to revile, and rate, and recreant call,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lastly to despoyle of knightly bannerall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And after all, for greater infamie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He by the heeles him hung upon a tree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And baffuld so, that all which passed by</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The picture of his punishment might see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by the like ensample warned bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How ever they through treason doe trespasse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But turne we now backe to that Ladie free,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom late we left ryding upon an Asse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Led by a Carle and foole which by her side did passe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She was a Ladie of great dignitie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And lifted up to honorable place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Famous through all the land of Faerie:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Though of meane parentage and kindred base,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet deckt with wondrous giftes of natures grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all men did her person much admire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And praise the feature of her goodly face;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The beames whereof did kindle lovely fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In th’ harts of many a knight, and many a gentle squire.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But she thereof grew proud and insolent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That none she worthie thought to be her fere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But scornd them all that love unto her ment:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet was she lov’d of many a worthy pere:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unworthy she to be belov’d so dere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That could not weigh of worthinesse aright;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For beautie is more glorious bright and clere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The more it is admir’d of many a wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And noblest she that served is of noblest knight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But this coy Damzell thought contrariwize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That such proud looks would make her praysed more;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that, the more she did all love despize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The more would wretched lovers her adore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What cared she who sighed for her sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or who did wayle or watch the wearie night?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let them that list their lucklesse lot deplore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She was borne free, not bound to any wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so would ever live, and love her owne delight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Through such her stubborne stifnesse and hard hart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Many a wretch for want of remedie</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did languish long in life-consuming smart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And at the last through dreary dolour die:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whylest she, the Ladie of her libertie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did boast her beautie had such soveraine might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with the onely twinckle of her eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She could or save or spill whom she would hight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What could the Gods doe more, but doe it more aright?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But loe! the Gods, that mortall follies vew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did worthily revenge this maydens pride;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, nought regarding her so goodly hew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did laugh at her that many did deride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whilest she did weepe, of no man mercifide:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For on a day, when Cupid kept his court,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he is wont at each Saint Valentide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the which all lovers doe resort,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of their loves successe they there may make report;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It fortun’d then, that when the roules were red</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which the names of all loves folke were fyled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That many there were missing; which were ded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or kept in bands, or from their loves exyled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or by some other violence despoyled:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which when as Cupid heard, he wexed wroth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And doubting to be wronged or beguyled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He bad his eyes to be unblindfold both,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he might see his men, and muster them by oth.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then found he many missing of his crew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which wont doe suit and service to his might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of whom what was becomen no man knew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore a Jurie was impaneld streight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">T’enquire of them, whether by force, or sleight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or their owne guilt, they were away convayd?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom foule Infamie and fell Despight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gave evidence, that they were all betrayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And murdrcd cruelly by a rebellious Mayd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Fayre Mirabella was her name, whereby</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all those crymes she there indited was:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All which when Cupid heard, he by and by</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In great displeasure wild a Capias</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should issue forth t’attach that scornefull lasse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The warrant straight was made, and therewithall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A Baylieffe-errant forth in post did passe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom they by name there Portamore did call;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He which doth summon lovers to loves judgement hall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The damzell was attacht, and shortly brought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the barre whereas she was arrayned;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But she thereto nould plead, nor answere ought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even for stubborne pride which her restrayned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So judgement past, as is by law ordayned</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In cases like; which when at last she saw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her stubborne hart, which love before disdayned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gan stoupe; and, falling downe with humble awe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cryde mercie, to abate the extremitie of law.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The sonne of Venus, who is myld by kynd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But where he is provokt with peevishnesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto her prayers piteously enclynd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And did the rigour of his doome represse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet not so freely, but that nathelesse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He unto her a penance did impose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which was, that through this worlds wyde wildernes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She wander should in companie of those,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till she had sav’d so many loves as she did lose.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So now she had bene wandring two whole yeares</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Throughout the world in this uncomely case,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wasting her goodly hew in heavie teares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And her good dayes in dolorous disgrace:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet had she not in all these two yeares space</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saved but two; yet in two yeares before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through her dispiteous pride, whilest love lackt place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She had destroyed two and twenty more.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aie me! how could her love make half amends therefore?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And now she was uppon the weary way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When as the gentle Squire, with faire Serene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Met her in such misseeming foule array;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whiles that mighty man did her demeane</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With all the evill termes and cruell meane</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he could make: And eeke that angry foole</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which follow’d her, with cursed hands uncleane</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whipping her horse, did with his smarting toole</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Oft whip her dainty selfe, and much augment her doole.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ne ought it mote availe her to entreat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The one or th’other better her to use;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For both so wilfull were and obstinate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all her piteous plaint they did refuse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And rather did the more her beate and bruse:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But most the former villaine, which did lead</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her tyreling jade, was bent her to abuse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, though she were with wearinesse nigh dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet would not let her lite, nor rest a little stead:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For he was sterne and terrible by nature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eeke of person huge and hideous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Exceeding much the measure of mans stature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And rather like a Gyant monstruous:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For sooth he was descended of the hous</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of those old Gyants, which did warres darraine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against the heaven in order battailous;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sib to great Orgolio, which was slaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By Arthure, when as Unas Knight he did maintaine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His lookes were dreadfull, and his fiery eies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like two great Beacons, glared bright and wyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Glauncing askew, as if his enemies</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He scorned in his overweening pryde;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And stalking stately, like a Crane, did stryde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At every step uppon the tiptoes hie:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, all the way he went, on every syde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He gaz’d about and stared horriblie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if he with his lookes would all men terrific.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He wore no armour, ne for none did care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As no whit dreading any living wight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But in a Jacket, quilted richly rare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon checklaton, he was straungely dight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on his head a roll of linnen plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like to the Mores of Malaber, he wore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which his locks, as blacke as pitchy night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were bound about and voyded from before;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his hand a mighty yron club he bore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This was Disdaine, who led that Ladies horse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through thick and thin, through mountains and through plains,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Compelling her, where she would not, by force,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Haling her palfrey by the hempen raines:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that same foole, which most increast her paines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was Scorne; who having in his hand a whip,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her therewith yirks; and still, when she complaines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The more he laughes, and does her closely quip,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see her sore lament and bite her tender lip.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whose cruell handling when that Squire beheld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And saw those villaines her so vildely use,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His gentle heart with indignation sweld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And could no lenger beare so great abuse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As such a Lady so to beate and bruse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, to him stepping, such a stroke him lent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That forst him th’ halter from his hand to loose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And maugre all his might backe to relent:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Else had he surely there bene slaine, or fowly shent.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The villaine, wroth for greeting him so sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gathered him selfe together soone againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with his yron batton which he bore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let drive at him so dreadfully amaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That for his safety he did him constraine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To give him ground, and shift to every side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rather then once his burden to sustaine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For bootelesse thing him seemed to abide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So mighty blowes, or prove the puissaunce of his pride.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like as a Mastiffe having at a bay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A salvage Bull, whose cruell homes doe threat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Desperate daunger, if he them assay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Traceth his ground, and round about doth beat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To spy where he may some advauntage get,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whiles the beast doth rage and loudly rore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So did the Squire, the whiles the Carle did fret</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fume in his disdainefull mynd the more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And oftentimes by Turmagant and Mahound swore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nathelesse so sharpely still he him pursewd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That at advantage him at last he tooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When his foote slipt, (that slip he dearely rewd)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with his yron club to ground him strooke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where still he lay, ne out of swoune awooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till heavy hand the Carle upon him layd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And bound him fast: Tho, when he up did looke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And saw him selfe captiv’d, he was dismayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne powre had to withstand, ne hope of any ayd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then up he made him rise, and forward fare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Led in a rope which both his hands did bynd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ought that foole for pitty did him spare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But with his whip, him following behynd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him often scourg’d, and forst his feete to fynd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And other-whiles with bitter mockes and mowes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He would him scorne, that to his gentle mynd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was much more grievous then the others blowes:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Words sharpely wound, but greatest griefe of scorning growes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The faire Serena, when she saw him fall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under that villaines club, then surely thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That slaine he was, or made a wretched thrall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fled away with all the speede she mought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To seeke for safety; which long time she sought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And past through many perils by the way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere she againe to Calepine was brought:</span>
					<br/>

					<span class="i1">That all your other praises will deface,</span>

					<span class="i1">Who from the high degree of happy state</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fell into wretched woes, which she repented late.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who after thraldome of the gentle Squire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which she beheld with lamentable eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was touched with compassion entire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And much lamented his calamity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That for her sake fell into misery;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which booted nought for prayers nor for threat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To hope for to release or mollify,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For aye the more that she did them entreat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The more they him misust, and cruelly did beat.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So as they forward on their way did pas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him still reviling and afflicting sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They met Prince Arthure with Sir Enias,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(That was that courteous Knight, whom he before</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Having subdew’d yet did to life restore;)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom as they approcht, they gan augment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their cruelty, and him to punish more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Scourging and haling him more vehement;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if it them should grieve to see his punishment.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Squire him selfe, when as he saw his Lord</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The witnesse of his wretchednesse in place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was much asham’d that with an hempen cord</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He like a dog was led in captive case,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And did his head for bashfulnesse abase,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As loth to see or to be scene at all:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shame would be hid. But whenas Enias</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beheld two such, of two such villaines thrall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His manly mynde was much emmoved therewithall;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And to the Prince thus sayd: “See you, Sir Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The greatest shame that ever eye yet saw,</span>

					<span class="i1">See, how they doe the Lady hale and draw!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, if ye please to lend me leave awhile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will them soone acquite, and both of blame assoile.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Prince assented; and then he, streightway</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dismounting light, his shield about him threw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which approching thus he gan to say:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Abide, ye caytive treachetours untrew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That have with treason thralled unto you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These two, unworthy of your wretched bands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now your crime with cruelty pursew!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Abide, and from them lay your loathly hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or else abide the death that hard before you stands.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The villaine stayd not aunswer to invent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But with his yron club preparing way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His mindes sad message backe unto him sent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which descended with such dreadfull sway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That seemed nought the course thereof could stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No more then lightening from the lofty sky:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne list the Knight the powre thereof assay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose doome was death; but, lightly slipping by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unwares defrauded his intended destiny:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And, to requite him with the like againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With his sharpe sword he fiercely at him flew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And strooke so strongly, that the Carle with paine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saved him selfc but that he there him slew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet sav’d not so, but that the bloud it drew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gave his foe good hope of victory:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who therewith flesht upon him set anew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with the second stroke thought certainely</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To have supplyde the first, and paide the usury.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Fortune aunswerd not unto his call;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For, as his hand was heaved up on hight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The villaine met him in the middle fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with his club bet backe his brondyron bright</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So forcibly, that with his owne hands might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rebeaten backe upon himselfe againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He driven was to ground in selfe despight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From whence ere he recovery could gaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He in his necke had set his foote with fell disdaine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that the foole, which did that end awayte,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came running in; and, whilest on ground he lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Laide heavy hands on him and held so strayte,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That downe he kept him with his scornefull sway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So as he could not weld him any way:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whiles that other villaine went about</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him to have bound and thrald without delay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whiles the foole did him revile and flout,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Threatning to yoke them two and tame their corage stout.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As when a sturdy ploughman with his hynde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By strength have overthrowne a stubborne steare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They downe him hold, and fast with cords do bynde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till they him force the buxome yoke to beare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So did these two this Knight oft tug and teare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which when the Prince beheld, there standing by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He left his lofty steede to aide him neare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, buckling soone him selfe, gan fiercely fly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon that Carle to save his friend from jeopardy.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The villaine, leaving him unto his mate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be captiv’d and handled as he list,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Himselfe addrest unto this new debate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with his club him all about so blist,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he which way to turne him scarcely wist:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sometimes aloft he layd, sometimes alow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now here, now there, and oft him neare he mist;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So doubtfully, that hardly one could know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whether more wary were to give or ward the blow.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But yet the Prince so well enured was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With such huge strokes, approved oft in fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That way to them he gave forth right to pas;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne would endure the daunger of their might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But wayt advantage when they downe did light.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At last the caytive, after long discourse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When all his strokes he saw avoyded quite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Resolved in one t’assemble all his force,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And make one end of him without ruth or remorse.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His dreadfull hand he heaved up aloft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with his dreadfull instrument of yre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thought sure have pownded him to powder soft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or deepe emboweld in the earth entyre:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Fortune did not with his will conspire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For, ere his stroke attayned his intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The noble childe, preventing his desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under his club with wary boldnesse went,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And smote him on the knee that never yet was bent.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It never yet was bent, ne bent it now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Albe the stroke so strong and puissant were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That seem’d a marble pillour it could bow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But all that leg, which did his body beare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It crackt throughout, (yet did no bloud appeare,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So as it was unable to support</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So huge a burden on such broken geare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But fell to ground, like to a lumpe of durt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence he assayd to rise, but could not for his hurt.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Eftsoones the Prince to him full nimbly stept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And least he should recover foote againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His head meant from his shoulders to have swept.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which when the Lady saw, she cryde amaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Stay, stay, Sir Knight! for love of God abstaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From that unwares ye weetlesse doe intend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Slay not that Carle, though worthy to be slaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For more on him doth then him selfe depend:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My life will by his death have lamentable end.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He staide his hand according her desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet nathemore him suffred to arize;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, still suppressing, gan of her inquire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What meaning mote those uncouth words comprize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in that villaines health her safety lies;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, were no might in man, nor heart in Knights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which durst her dreaded reskue enterprize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet heavens them selves, that favour feeble rights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would for it selfe redresse, and punish such despights.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then bursting forth in teares, which gushed fast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like many water streames, awhile she stayd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till the sharpe passion being overpast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her tongue to her restord, then thus she sayd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Nor heavens, nor men, can me, most wretched mayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Deliver from the doome of my desart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which the God of love hath on me layd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And damned to endure this direfull smart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For penaunce of my proud and hard rebellious hart.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“In prime of youthly yeares, when first the flowre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of beauty gan to bud, and bloosme delight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Nature me endu’d with plenteous dowre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all her gifts, that pleasde each living sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I was belov’d of many a gentle Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sude and sought with all the service dew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full many a one for me deepe groand and sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to the dore of death for sorrow drew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Complayning out on me that would not on them rew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But let them love that list, or live or die,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Me list not die for any lovers doole;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne list me leave my loved libertie</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To pitty him that list to play the foole;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To love my selfe I learned had in schoole.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus I triumphed long in lovers paine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, sitting carelesse on the scorners stoole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did laugh at those that did lament and plaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But all is now repayd with interest againe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“For loe! the winged God that woundeth harts</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Causde me be called to accompt therefore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And for revengement of those wrongfull smarts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which I to others did inflict afore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Addeem’d me to endure this penaunce sore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in this wize, and this unmeete array,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With these two lewd companions, and no more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Disdaine and Scorne, I through the world should stray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till I have sav’d so many as I earst did slay.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Certes,” (sayd then the Prince) “the God is just,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That taketh vengeaunce of his peoples spoile;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For were no law in love, but all that lust</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Might them oppresse, and painefully turmoile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His kingdome would continue but a while.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But tell me, Lady, wherefore doe you beare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This bottle thus before you with such toile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eeke this wallet at your backe arreare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That for these Carles to carry much more comely were?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Here in this bottle” (sayd the sory Mayd)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“I put the tears of my contrition,</span>

					<span class="i1">Till to the brim I have it full defrayd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in this bag, which I behinde me don,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I put repentaunce for things past and gon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet is the bottle leake, and bag so torne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all which I put in fals out anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And is behinde me trodden downe of Scorne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who mocketh all my paine, and laughs the more I mourn.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Infant hearkned wisely to her tale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wondred much at Cupids judg’ment wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That could so meekly make proud hearts avale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wreake him selfe on them that him despise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then suffred he Disdaine up to arise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who was not able up him selfe to reare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By meanes his leg, through his late luckelesse prise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was crackt in twaine, but by his foolish feare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was holpen up, who him supported standing neare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But being up he lookt againe aloft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if he never had received fall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with sterne eye-browes stared at him oft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if he would have daunted him withall:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And standing on his tiptoes, to seeme tall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Downe on his golden feete he often gazed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if such pride the other could apall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who was so far from being ought amazed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he his lookes despised, and his boast dispraized.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then turning backe unto that captive thrall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who all this while stood there beside them bound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unwilling to be knowne or scene at all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He from those bands weend him to have unwound;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when approaching neare he plainely found</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It was his owne true groome, the gentle Squire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He thereat wext exceedingly astound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And him did oft embrace, and oft admire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne could with seeing satisfie his great desire.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Meane-while the Salvage man, when he beheld</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That huge great foole oppressing th’other Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom with his weight unweldy downe he held,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He flew upon him like a greedy kight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto some carrion offered to his sight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, downc him plucking, with his nayles and teeth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gan him to hale, and teare, and scratch, and bite;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, from him taking his owne whip, therewith</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So sore him scourgeth that the bloud downe followeth.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And sure I weene, had not the Ladies cry</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Procured the Prince his cruell hand to stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He would with whipping him have done to dye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But being checkt he did abstaine streightway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And let him rise. Then thus the Prince gan say:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Now, Lady, sith your fortunes thus dispose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That if ye list have liberty ye may;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto your selfe I freely leave to chose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whether I shall you leave, or from these villaines lose.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Ah! nay, Sir Knight,” (said she) “it may not be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that I needes must by all meanes fulfill</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This penaunce, which enjoyned is to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Least unto me betide a greater ill;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet no lesse thankes to you for your good will.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So humbly taking leave she turnd aside;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Arthure with the rest went onward still</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On his first quest, in which did him betide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A great adventure, which did him from them devide.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But first it falleth me by course to tell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of faire Serena; who, as earst you heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When first the gentle Squire at variaunce fell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With those two Carles, fled fast away, afeard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of villany to be to her inferd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So fresh the image of her former dread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet dwelling in her eye, to her appeard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That every foote did tremble which did tread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every body two, and two she foure did read.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Through hils and dales, through bushes and through breres,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Long thus she fled, till that at last she thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her selfe now past the perill of her feares:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then looking round about, and seeing nought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which doubt of daunger to her offer mought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She from her palfrey lighted on the plaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, sitting downe, her selfe awhile bethought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of her long travell and turmoyling paine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And often did of love, and oft of lucke complaine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And evermore she blamed Calepine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The good Sir Calepine, her owne true Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As th’onely author of her wofull tine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For being of his love to her so light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As her to leave in such a piteous plight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet never Turtle truer to his make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then he was tride unto his Lady bright;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who all this while endured for her sake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Great perill of his life, and restlesse paines did take.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tho when as all her plaints she had displayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And well disburdened her engrieved brest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the grasse her selfe adowne she layd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where, being tyrde with travell, and opprest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With sorrow, she betooke her selfe to rest:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There whilest in Morpheus bosome safe she lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fearelesse of ought that mote her peace molest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">False Fortune did her safety betray</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto a strange mischaunce that menac’d her decay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In these wylde deserts where she now abode,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There dwelt a salvage nation, which did live</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of stealth and spoile, and making nightly rode</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into their neighbours borders; ne did give</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Them selves to any trade, (as for to drive</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The painefull plough, or cattell for to breed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or by adventrous marchandize to thrive,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But on the labours of poore men to feed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And serve their owne necessities with others need.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thereto they usde one most accursed order,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To eate the flesh of men whom they mote fynde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And straungers to devoure, which on their border</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were brought by errour or by wreckfull wynde;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A monstrous cruelty gainst course of kynde!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They, towards evening wandering every way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To seeke for booty, came by fortune blynde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereas this Lady, like a sheepe astray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now drowned in the depth of sleepe all fearelesse lay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Soone as they spide her, Lord! what gladfull glee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They made amongst them selves; but when her face</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like the faire yvory shining they did see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Each gan his fellow solace and embrace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For joy of such good hap by heavenly grace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then gan they to devize what course to take;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whether to slay her there upon the place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or suffer her out of her sleepe to wake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then her eate attonce, or many meales to make.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The best advizement was, of bad, to let her</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sleepe out her fill without encomberment;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For sleepe, they sayd, would make her battill better:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then when she wakt they all gave one consent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, since by grace of God she there was sent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto their God they would her sacrifize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose share, her guiltlesse bloud, they woul d present;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But of her dainty flesh they did devize</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make a common feast, and feed with gurmandize.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So round about her they them selves did place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the grasse, and diversely dispose</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As each thought best to spend the lingring space:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some with their eyes the daintest morsels chose;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some praise her paps; some praise her lips and nose;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some whet their knives, and strip their elboes bare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Priest him selfe a garland doth compose</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of finest flowers, and with full busie care</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His bloudy vessels wash, and holy fire prepare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Damzell wakes; then all attonce upstart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And round about her flocke, like many flies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whooping and hallowing on every part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if they would have rent the brasen skies.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which when she sees with ghastly griefful eies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her heart does quake, and deadly pallied hew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Benumbes her cheekes: Then out aloud she cries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where none is nigh to heare that will her rew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And rends her golden locks, and snowy brests embrew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But all bootes not; they hands upon her lay:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And first they spoile her of her jewels deare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And afterwards of all her rich array;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which amongst them they in peeces teare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of the pray each one a part doth beare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now being naked, to their sordid eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The goodly threasures of nature appeare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which as they view with lustfull fantasyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each wisheth to him selfe, and to the rest envyes:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Her yvorie neck; her alablaster Brest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her paps, which like white silken pillowes were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For love in soft delight thereon to rest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her tender sides; her bellie white and clere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which like an Altar did itselfe uprere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To offer sacrifice divine thereon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her goodly thighes, whose glorie did appeare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like a triumphal Arch, and thereupon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The spoiles of Princes hang’d which were in battel won.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Those daintie parts, the dearlings of delight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which mote not be prophan’d of common eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those villeins view’d with loose lascivious sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And closely tempted with their craftie spyes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And some of them gan mongst themselves devize</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereof by force to take their beastly pleasure:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But them the Priest rebuking did advize</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To dare not to pollute so sacred threasure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vow’d to the gods: religion held even theeves in measure.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So, being stayd, they her from thence directed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto a litle grove not farre asyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which an altar shortly they erected</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To slay her on. And now the Eventyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His brode black wings had through the heavens wyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By this dispred, that was the tyme ordayned</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For such a dismall deed, their guilt to hyde:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of few greene turfes an altar soone they fayned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And deckt it all with flowres which they nigh hand obtayned.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tho, when as all things readie were aright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Te Damzell was before the altar set,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Being alreadie dead with fearefull fright:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom the Priest with naked armes full net</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Approching nigh, and murdrous knife well whet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gan mutter close a certaine secret charme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With other divelish ceremonies met:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which doen, he gan aloft t’advance his arme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat they shouted all, and made a loud alarme.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then gan the bagpypes and the homes to shrill</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And shrieke aloud, that, with the peoples voyce</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Confused, did the ayre with terror fill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And made the wood to tremble at the noyce:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whyles she wayld, the more they did rejoyce.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now mote ye understand that to this grove</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sir Calepine, by chaunce more then by choyce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The selfe same evening fortune hether drove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he to seeke Serena through the woods did rove.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Long had he sought her, and through many a soyle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had traveld still on foot in heavie armes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ought was tyred with his endlesse toyle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ought was feared of his certaine harmes:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now, all weetlesse of the wretched stormes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which his love was lost, he slept full fast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till, being waked with these loud alarmes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He lightly started up like one aghast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, catching up his arms, streight to the noise forth past.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There by th’uncertaine glims of starry night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by the twinkling of their sacred fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He mote perceive a litle dawning sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all which there was doing in that quire:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mongst whom a woman spoyld of all attire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He spyde lamenting her unluckie strife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And groning sore from grieved hart entire:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eftsoones he saw one with a naked knife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Readie to launch her brest, and let out loved life.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that he thrusts into the thickest throng</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, even as his right hand adowne descends,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He him preventing layes on earth along,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sacrifizeth to th’infernall feends:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then to the rest his wrathfull hand he bends;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of whom he makes such havocke and such hew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That swarmes of damned soules to hell he sends:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The rest, that scape his sword and death eschew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fly like a flocke of doves before a Faulcons vew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>From them returning to that Ladie backe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom by the Altar he doth sitting find</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet fearing death, and next to death the lacke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of clothes to cover what they ought by kind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He first her hands beginneth to unbind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then to question of her present woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And afterwards to cheare with speaches kind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But she, for nought that he could say or doe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One word durst speake, or answere him awhit thereto.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So inward shame of her uncomely case</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She did conceive, through care of womanhood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That though the night did cover her disgrace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet she in so unwomanly a mood</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would not bewray the state in which she stood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So all that night to him unknowen she past;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But day, that doth discover bad and good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ensewing, made her knowen to him at last:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The end whereof He keepe untill another cast.</span>

					<span>Now turne againe my teme, thou jolly swayne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Backe to the furrow which I lately left.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I lately left a furrow, one or twayne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unplough’d, the which my coulter hath not cleft;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet seem’d the soyle both fayre and frutefull eft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As I it past: that were too great a shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That so rich frute should be from us bereft;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Besides the great dishonour and defame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which should befall to Calidores immortall name.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Great travell hath the gentle Calidore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And toyle endured, sith I left him last</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sewing the Blatant Beast; which I forebore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To finish then, for other present hast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full many pathes and perils he hath past,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through hils, through dales, through forests, and through plaines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In that same quest which fortune on him cast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which he atchieved to his owne great gaines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reaping eternall glorie of his restlesse paines.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So sharply he the Monster did pursew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That day nor night he suffred him to rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne rested he himselfe, but natures dew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For dread of daunger not to be redrest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If he for slouth forslackt so famous quest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him first from court he to the citties coursed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from the citties to the townes him prest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from the townes into the countrie forsed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And from the country back to private farmes he scorsed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>From thence into the open fields he fled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereas the Heardes were keeping of their neat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And shepherds singing to their flockes (that fed)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Layes of sweete love and youthes delightfull heat:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him thether eke, for all his fearefull threat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He followed fast, and chaced him so nie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That to the folds, where sheepe at night doe seat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to the litle cots, where shepherds lie</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In winters wrathfull time, he forced him to flie.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There on a day, as he pursew’d the chace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He chaunst to spy a sort of shepheard groomes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Playing on pipes and caroling apace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whyles their beasts there in the budded broomes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beside them fed, and nipt the tender bloomes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For other worldly wealth they cared nought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom Sir Calidore yet sweating comes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And them to tell him courteously besought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If such a beast they saw, which he had thether brought.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They answer’d him that no such beast they saw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor any wicked feend that mote offend</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their happie flockes, nor daunger to them draw;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But if that such there were (as none they kend)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They prayd high God them farre from them to send.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then one of them, him seeing so to sweat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After his rusticke wise, that well he weend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Offred him drinke to quench his thirstie heat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, if he hungry were, him offred eke to eat.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The knight was nothing nice, where was no need,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And tooke their gentle offer: so adowne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They prayd him sit, and gave him for to feed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such homely what as serves the simple clowne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That doth despise the dainties of the towne.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tho, having fed his fill, he there besyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saw a faire damzell, which did wearc a crowne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of sundry flowres with silken ribbands tyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yclad in home-made greene that her owne hands had dyde.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Upon a litle hillocke she was placed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Higher then all the rest, and round about</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Environed with a girland, goodly graced,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of lovely lasses; and them all without</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The lustie shepheard swaynes sate in a rout,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which did pype and sing her prayses dew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And oft rejoyce, and oft for wonder shout,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if some miracle of heavenly hew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were downe to them descended in that earthly vew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And soothly sure she was full fayre of face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And perfectly well shapt in every lim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which she did more augment with modest grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And comely carriage of her count’nance trim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all the rest like lesser lamps did dim:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, her admiring as some heavenly wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did for their soveraine goddesse her esteeme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, caroling her name both day and night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fayrest Pastorella her by name did hight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ne was there heard, ne was there shepheards swayne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But her did honour; and eke many a one</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Burnt in her love, and with sweet pleasing payne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full many a night for her did sigh and grone:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But most of all the shepheard Coridon</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For her did languish, and his deare life spend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet neither she for him nor other none</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did care a whit, ne any liking lend:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though meane her lot, yet higher did her mind ascend.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Her whyles Sir Calidore there vewed well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And markt her rare demeanure, which him seemed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So farre the meane of shepheards to excell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As that he in his mind her worthy deemed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be a Princes Paragone esteemed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He was unwares surprisd in subtile bands</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the blynd boy; ne thence could be redeemed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By any skill out of his cruell hands;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Caught like the bird which gazing still on others stands.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So stood he still long gazing thereupon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne any will had thence to move away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Although his quest were farre afore him gon:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But after he had fed, yet did he stay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sate there still, untill the flying day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was farre forth spent, discoursing diversly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of sundry things as fell, to worke delay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And evermore his speach he did apply</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To th’ heards, but meant them to the damzels fantazy.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>By this the moystie night approching fast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her deawy humour gan on th’earth to shed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That warn’d the shepheards to their homes to hast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their tender flocks, now being fully fed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For feare of wetting them before their bed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then came to them a good old aged syre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose silver lockes bedeckt his beard and hed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With shepheards hooke in hand, and fit attyre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That wild the damzell rise; the day did now expyre.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He was, to weet, by common voice esteemed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The father of the fayrest Pastorell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of her selfe in very deede so deemed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet was not so; but, as old stories tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Found her by fortune, which to him befell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In th’open fields an Infant left alone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, taking up, brought home and noursed well</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As his owne chyld; for other he had none;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she in trad: of time accompted was his owne.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She at his bidding meekely did arise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And streight unto her litle flocke did fare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then all the rest about her rose likewise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And each his sundrie sheepe with severall care</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gathered together, and them homeward bare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whylest everie one with helping hands did strive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Amongst themselves, and did their labours share,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To helpc faire Pastorella home to drive</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her fleecie flocke; but Coridon most helpe did give.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Meliboee (so hight that good old man)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now seeing Calidore left all alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And night arrived hard at hand, began</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him to invite unto his simple home;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which though it were a cottage clad with lome,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all things therein meane, yet better so</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To lodge then in the salvage fields to rome.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The knight full gladly soone agreed thereto,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Being his harts owne wish,) and home with him did go.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There he was wclcom’d of that honest syre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of his aged Beldame homely well;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who him besought himselfe to disattyre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And rest himselfe till supper time befell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By which home came the fayrest Pastorell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After her flocke she in their fold had tyde:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And supper readie dight they to it fell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With small adoe, and nature satisfyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The which doth litle crave contented to abyde.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tho when they had their hunger slaked well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the fayre mayd the table ta’ne away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The gentle knight, as he that did excell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In courtesie and well could doe and say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For so great kindnesse as he found that day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gan greatly thanke his host and his good wife;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And drawing thence his speach another way,</span>
					<br/>

					<span>“How much” (sayd he) “more happie is the state</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which ye, father, here doe dwell at ease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Leading a life so free and fortunate</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The time was once, in my first prime of yeares,</span>

					<span class="i1">And, leaving home, to roiall court I sought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where I did sell my selfe for yearely hire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in the Princes gardin daily wrought:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There I beheld such vainenesse as I never thought.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“With sight whereof soone cloyd, and long deluded</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With idle hopes which them doe entertaine,</span>

					<span class="i1">After I had ten yeares my selfe excluded</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From native home, and spent my youth in vaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I gan my follies to my selfe to plaine,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whylest thus he talkt, the knight with greedy eare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hong still upon his melting mouth attent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose sensefull words empierst his hart so neare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he was rapt with double ravishment,</span>

					<span class="i1">Both of his speach, that wrought him great content,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And also of the object of his vew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On which his hungry eye was alwayes bent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That twixt his pleasing tongue, and her faire hew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He lost himselfe, and like one halfe entraunced grew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet to occasion meanes to worke his mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to insinuate his harts desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He thus replyde: “Now surely, syre, I find,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all this worlds gay showes, which we admire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be but vaine shadowes to this safe retyre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of life, which here in lowlinesse ye lead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fearelesse of foes, or fortunes wrackfull yre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which tosseth states, and under foot doth tread</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mightie ones, affrayd of every chaunges dread.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“That even I, which daily doe behold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The glorie of the great mongst whom I won,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now have prov’d what happinesse ye hold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In this small plot of your dominion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now loath great Lordship and ambition;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wish th’ heavens so much had graced mee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As graunt me live in like condition;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or that my fortunes might transposed bee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From pitch of higher place unto this low degree.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“In vaine” (said then old Melibce) “doe men</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The heavens of their fortunes fault accuse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sith they know best what is the best for them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For they to each such fortune doe diffuse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As they doe know each can most aptly use:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For not that which men covet most is best,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor that thing worst which men do most refuse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But fittest is, that all contented rest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With that they hold: each hath his fortune in his brest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“It is the mynd that maketh good or ill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That maketh wretch or happie, rich or poore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For some, that hath abundance at his will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hath not enough, but wants in greatest store,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And other, that hath litle, askes no more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But in that litle is both rich and wise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For wisedome is most riches: fooles therefore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They are which fortunes doe by vowes devize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sith each unto himselfe his life may fortunize.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Since then in each mans self” (said Calidore)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“It is to fashion his owne lyfes estate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Give leave awhyle, good father, in this shore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To rest my barcke, which hath bene beaten late</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With stormes of fortune and tempestuous fate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In seas of troubles and of toylesome paine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, whether quite from them for to retrate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I shall resolve, or backe to turne againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I may here with your selfe some small repose obtaine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Not that the burden of so bold a guest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall chargefull be, or chaunge to you at all;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For your meane food shall be my daily feast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this your cabin both my bowre and hall:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Besides, for recompence hereof I shall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">You well reward, and golden guerdon give,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That may perhaps you better much withall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in this quiet make you safer live.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So forth he drew much gold, and toward him it drive.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But the good man, nought tempted with the offer</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his rich mould, did thrust it farre away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thus bespake: “Sir knight, your bounteous proffer</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be farre fro me, to whom ye ill display</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That mucky masse, the cause of mens decay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That mote empaire my peace with daungers dread;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, if ye algates covet to assay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This simple sort of life that shepheards lead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be it your owne: our rudenesse to your selfe aread.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So there that night Sir Calidore did dwell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And long while after, whilest him list remaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dayly beholding the faire Pastorell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And feeding on the bayt of his owne bane:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">During which time he did her entertaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With all kind courtesies he could invent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And every day, her companie to gaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When to the field she went he with her went:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So for to quench his fire he did it more augment.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But she that never had acquainted beene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With such queint usage, fit for Queenes and Kings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ever had such knightly service scene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, being bred under base shepheards wings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had ever learn’d to love the lowly things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did litle whit regard his courteous guize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But cared more for Colins carolings</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then all that he could doe, or ever devize:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His layes, his loves, his lookes, she did them all despize.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which Calidore perceiving, thought it best</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To chaunge the manner of his loftie looke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And doffing his bright armes himselfe addrest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In shepheards weed; and in his hand he tooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Instead of steele-head speare, a shepheards hooke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That who had scene him then, would have bethought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On Phrygian Paris by Plexippus brooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When he the love of fayre Oenone sought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What time the golden apple was unto him brought.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So being clad unto the fields he went</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the faire Pastorella every day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And kept her sheepe with diligent attent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Watching to drive the ravenous Wolfe away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whylest at pleasure she mote sport and play;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And every evening helping them to fold:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And otherwhiles, for need, he did assay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In his strong hand their rugged teats to hold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And out of them to presse the milke: love so much could.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which seeing Coridon, who her likewise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Long time had lov’d, and hop’d her love to gaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He much was troubled at that straungers guize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And many gealous thoughts conceiv’d in vaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That this of all his labour and long paine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should reap the harvest ere it ripened were:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That made him scoule, and pout, and oft complaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Pastorell to all the shepheards there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she did love a stranger swayne then him more dere.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And ever, when he came in companie</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where Calidore was present, he would loure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And byte his lip, and even for gealousie</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was readie oft his owne heart to devoure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Impatient of any paramoure:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, on the other side, did seeme so farre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From malicing, or grudging his good houre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all he could he graced him with her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne ever shewed signe of rancour or of jarre.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And oft, when Coridon unto her brought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or litle sparrowes stolen from their nest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or wanton squirrels in the woods farre sought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or other daintie thing for her addrest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He would commend his guift, and make the best;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet she no whit his presents did regard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne him could find to fancie in her brest:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This new-come shepheard had his market mard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Old love is litle worth when new is more prefard.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One day, when as the shepheard swaynes together</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were met to make their sports and merrie glee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As they are wont in faire sunshynie weather,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whiles their flockes in shadowes shrouded bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They fell to daunce: then did they all agree</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Colin Clout should pipe, as one most fit;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Calidore should lead the ring, as hee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That most in Pastorellaes grace did sit:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereat frown’d Coridon, and his lip closely bit.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Calidore, of courteous inclination,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tooke Coridon and set him in his place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he should lead the daunce, as was his fashion;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For Coridon could daunce, and trimly trace:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And when as Pastorella, him to grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her flowry garlond tooke from her owne head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And plast on his, he did it soone displace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And did it put on Coridons instead:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then Coridon woxe frollicke, that earst seemed dead.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Another time, when as they did dispose</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To practise games and maisteries to try,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They for their Judge did Pastorella chose;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A garland was the meed of victory:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There Coridon forth stepping openly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did chalenge Calidore to wrestling game;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For he, through long and perfect industry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therein well practisd was, and in the same</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thought sure t’avenge his grudge, and worke his foe great shame.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Calidore he greatly did mistake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For he was strong and mightily stiffe pight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with one fall his necke he almost brake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And had he not upon him fallen light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His dearest joynt he sure had broken quight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then was the oaken crowne by Pastorell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Given to Calidore as his due right;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he, that did in courtesie excell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gave it to Coridon, and said he wonne it well.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus did the gentle knight himselfe abeare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Amongst that rusticke rout in all his deeds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That even they, the which his rivals were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could not maligne him, but commend him needs;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For courtesie amongst the rudest breeds</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Good will and favour. So it surely wrought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With this faire Mayd, and in her mynde the seeds</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of perfect love did sow, that last forth brought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fruite of joy and blisse, though long time dearely bought.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus Calidore continu’d there long time</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To winne the love of the faire Pastorell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which having got, he used without crime</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or blamefull blot; but menaged so well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he, of all the rest which there did dwell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was favoured and to her grace commended.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But what straunge fortunes unto him befell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere he attain’d the point by him intended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall more conveniently in other place be ended.</span>

					<span class="i1">For who had tasted once (as oft did he)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The happy peace which there doth overflow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And prov’d the perfect pleasures which doe grow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Amongst poore hyndes, in hils, in woods, in dales,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would never more delight in painted show</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of such false blisse, as there is set for stales</span>
					<br/>
					<span>T’entrap unwary fooles in their eternall bales.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For what hath all that goodly glorious gaze</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like to one sight which Calidore did vew?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The glaunce whereof their dimmed eies would daze,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That never more they should endure the shew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that sunne-shine that makes them looke askew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ought, in all that world of beauties rare,</span>

					<span class="i1">(Save onely Glorianaes heavenly hew,</span>

					<span class="i1">To which what can compare?) can it compare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The which, as commeth now by course, I will declare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One day, as he did raunge the fields abroad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whilest his faire Pastorella was elsewhere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He chaunst to come, far from all peoples troad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto a place whose pleasaunce did appere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To passe all others on the earth which were:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For all that ever was by natures skill</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Devized to worke delight was gathered there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And there by her were poured forth at fill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if, this to adorne, she all the rest did pill.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It was an hill plaste in an open plaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That round about was bordered with a wood</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of matchlesse night, that seem’d th’earth to disdaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which all trees of honour stately stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And did all winter as in sommer bud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Spredding pavilions for the birds to bowre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which in their lower braunches sung aloud;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in their tops the soring hauke did towre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sitting like King of fowles in majesty and powre:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And at the foote thereof a gentle flud</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His silver waves did softly tumble downe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unmard with ragged mosse or filthy mud;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne mote wylde beastes, ne mote the ruder clowne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereto approch; ne filth mote therein drowne:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Nymphes and Faeries by the bancks did sit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the woods shade which did the waters crowne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Keeping all noysome things away from it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the waters fall tuning their accents fit.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And on the top thereof a spacious plaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did spred it selfe, to serve to all delight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Either to daunce, when they to daunce would faine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or else to course about their bases light;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ought there wanted which for pleasure might</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Desired be, or thence to banish bale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So pleasauntly the hill with equall hight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did seeme to overlooke the lowly vale;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore it rightly cleeped was mount Acidale.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They say that Venus, when she did dispose</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her selfe to pleasaunce, used to resort</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto this place, and therein to repose</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And rest her selfe as in a gladsome port,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or with the Graces there to play and sport;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That even her owne Cytheron, though in it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She used most to keepe her royall court,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in her soveraine Majesty to sit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She in regard hereof refusde and thought unfit.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Unto this place when as the Elfin Knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Approcht, him seemed that the merry sound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of a shrill pipe he playing heard on hight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And many feete fast thumping th’ hollow ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That through the woods their Eccho did rebound.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He nigher drew to weete what mote it be:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There he a troupe of Ladies dauncing found</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full merrily, and making gladfull glee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the midst a Shepheard piping he did see.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He durst not enter into th’open greene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For dread of them unwares to be descryde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For breaking of their daunce, if he were scene;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But in the covert of the wood did byde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beholding all, yet of them unespyde.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There he did see that pleased much his sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That even he him selfe his eyes envyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An hundred naked maidens lilly white</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All raunged in a ring and dauncing in delight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All they without were raunged in a ring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And daunced round; but in the midst of them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Three other Ladies did both daunce and sing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whilest the rest them round about did hemme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And like a girlond did in compasse stemme:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in the middest of those same three was placed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another Damzell, as a precious gemme</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Amidst a ring most richly well enchaced,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That with her goodly presence all the rest much graced.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Looke! how the crowne, which Ariadne wore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon her yvory forehead, that same day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Theseus her unto his bridale bore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When the bold Centaures made that bloudy fray</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the fierce Lapithes which did them dismay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Being now placed in the firmament,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through the bright heaven doth her beams display,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And is unto the starres an ornament,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which round about her move in order excellent.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Such was the beauty of this goodly band,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose sundry parts were here too long to tell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But she that in the midst of them did stand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seem’d all the rest in beauty to excell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Crownd with a rosie girlond that right well</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did her beseeme: And ever, as the crew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">About her daunst, sweet flowres that far did smell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fragrant odours they uppon her threw;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But most of all those three did her with gifts endew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Those were the Graces, daughters of delight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Handmaides of Venus, which are wont to haunt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uppon this hill, and daunce there day and night:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those three to men all gifts of grace do graunt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all that Venus in her selfe doth vaunt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is borrowed of them. But that faire one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in the midst was placed paravaunt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was she to whom that shepheard pypt alone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That made him pipe so merrily, as never none.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She was, to weete, that jolly Shepheards lasse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which piped there unto that merry rout;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That jolly shepheard, which there piped, was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Poore Colin Clout, (who knowes not Colin Clout?)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He pypt apace, whilest they him daunst about.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pype, jolly shepheard, pype thou now apace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto thy love that made thee low to lout:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy love is present there with thee in place;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy love is there advaunst to be another Grace.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Much wondred Calidore at this straunge sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose like before his eye had never scene;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And standing long astonished in spright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And rapt with pleasaunce, wist not what to weene;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whether it were the traine of beauties Queene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or Nymphes, or Faeries, or enchaunted show,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which his eyes mote have deluded beene.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore, resolving what it was to know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of the wood he rose, and toward them did go.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, soone as he appeared to their vew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They vanisht all away out of his sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And cleane were gone, which way he never knew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All save the shepheard, who, for fell despight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that displeasure, broke his bag-pipe quight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And made great mone for that unhappy turne:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Calidore, though no lesse sory wight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For that mishap, yet seeing him to mourne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Drew neare, that he the truth of all by him mote learne.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And, first him greeting, thus unto him spake:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Haile, jolly shepheard, which thy joyous dayes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here leadest in this goodly merry-make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Frequented of these gentle Nymphes alwayes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which to thee flocke to heare thy lovely layes!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tell me, what mote these dainty Damzells be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which here with thee doe make their pleasant playes?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Right happy thou that mayst them freely see!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But why, when I them saw, fled they away from me?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Not I so happy,” answerd then that swaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“As thou unhappy, which them thence didst chace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom by no meanes thou canst recall againe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For, being gone, none can them bring in place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But whom they of them selves list so to grace.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Right sory I,” (saide then Sir Calidore)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“That my ill fortune did them hence displace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But since things passed none may now restore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell me what were they all, whose lacke thee grieves so sore?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tho gan that shepheard thus for to dilate:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Then wote, thou shepheard, whatsoever thou bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all those Ladies, which thou sawest late,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are Venus Damzels, all within her fee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But differing in honour and degree:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They all are Graces which on her depend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Besides a thousand more which ready bee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her to adorne, when so she forth doth wend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But those three in the midst doe chiefe on her attend.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“They are the daughters of sky-ruling Jove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By him begot of faire Eurynome,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Oceans daughter, in this pleasant grove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he, this way comming from feastfull glee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Thetis wedding with Aeacidee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In sommers shade him selfe here rested weary:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The first of them hight mylde Euphrosyne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Next faire Aglaia, last Thalia merry;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sweete Goddesses all three, which me in mirth do cherry!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“These three on men all gracious gifts bestow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which decke the body or adorne the mynde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To make them lovely or well-favoured show;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As comely carriage, entertainement kynde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sweete semblaunt, friendly offices that bynde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the complements of curtesie:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They teach us how to each degree and kynde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We should our selves demeane, to low, to hie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To friends, to foes; which skill men call Civility.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Therefore they alwaies smoothly seeme to smile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That we likewise should mylde and gentle be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And also naked are, that without guile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or false dissemblaunce all them plaine may see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Simple and true, from covert malice free;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eeke them selves so in their daunce they bore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That two of them still froward seem’d to bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But one still towards shew’d her selfe afore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That good should from us goe, then come, in greater store.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Such were those Goddesses which ye did see;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that fourth Mayd, which there amidst them traced,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who can aread what creature mote she bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whether a creature, or a goddesse graced</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With heavenly gifts from heven first enraced?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But what so sure she was, she worthy was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be the fourth with those three other placed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet was she certes but a countrey lasse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet she all other countrey lasses farre did passe:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“So farre, as doth the daughter of the day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All other lesser lights in light excell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So farre doth she in beautyfull array</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above all other lasses beare the bell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne lesse in vertue that beseemes her well</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth she exceede the rest of all her race,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For which the Graces, that here wont to dwell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have for more honor brought her to this place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And graced her so much to be another Grace.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Another Grace she well deserves to be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In whom so many Graces gathered are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Excelling much the meane of her degree;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Divine resemblaunce, beauty soveraine rare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Firme Chastity, that spight ne blemish dare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All which she with such courtesie doth grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all her peres cannot with her compare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But quite are dimmed when she is in place:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She made me often pipe, and now to pipe apace.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Sunne of the world, great glory of the sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all the earth doest lighten with thy rayes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Great Gloriana, greatest Majesty!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pardon thy shepheard, mongst so many layes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he hath sung of thee in all his dayes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To make one minime of thy poore handmayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And underneath thy feete to place her prayse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That when thy glory shall be farre displayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To future age, of her this mention may be made!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When thus that shepheard ended had his speach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sayd Calidore: “Now sure it yrketh mee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That to thy blisse I made this luckelesse breach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As now the author of thy bale to be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus to bereave thy loves deare sight from thee:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, gentle Shepheard, pardon thou my shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who rashly sought that which I mote not see.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus did the courteous Knight excuse his blame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to recomfort him all comely meanes did frame.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In such discourses they together spent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Long time, as fit occasion forth them led;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which the Knight him selfe did much content,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with delight his greedy fancy fed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both of his words, which he with reason red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And also of the place, whose pleasures rare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With such regard his sences ravished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That thence he had no will away to fare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But wisht that with that shepheard he mote dwelling share.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But that envenimd sting, the which of yore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His poysnous point deepe fixed in his hart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had left, now gan afresh to rancle sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to renue the rigour of his smart;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which to recure no skill of Leaches art</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mote him availe, but to returne againe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To his wounds worker, that with lovely dart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dinting his brest had bred his restlesse paine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like as the wounded Whale to shore flies from the maine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So, taking leave of that same gentle Swaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He backe returned to his rusticke wonne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where his faire Pastorella did remaine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whome, in sort as he at first begonne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He daily did apply him selfe to donne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All dewfull service, voide of thoughts impure;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne any paines ne perill did he shonne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By which he might her to his love allure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And liking in her yet untamed heart procure.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And evermore the shepheard Coridon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What ever thing he did her to aggrate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did strive to match with strong contention,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all his paines did closely emulate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whether it were to caroll, as they sate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Keeping their sheepe, or games to exercize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or to present her with their labours late;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through which if any grace chaunst to arize</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To him, the Shepheard streight with jealousie did frize.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One day, as they all three together went</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To the greene wood to gather strawberies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There chaunst to them a dangerous accident:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A Tigre forth out of the wood did rise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with fell clawes full of fierce gourmandize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And greedy mouth wide gaping like hell-gate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did runne at Pastorell her to surprize;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom she beholding, now all desolate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gan cry to them aloud to helpe her all too late.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which Coridon first hearing ran in hast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To reskue her; but, when he saw the feend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through cowherd feare he fled away as fast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne durst abide the daunger of the end;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His life he steemed dearer then his frend:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Calidore soone comming to her ayde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When he the beast saw ready now to rend</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His loves deare spoile, in which his heart was prayde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He ran at him enraged, instead of being frayde.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He had no weapon but his shepheards hooke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To serve the vengeaunce of his wrathfull will;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which so sternely he the monster strooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That to the ground astonished he fell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence, ere he could recou’r, he did him quell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, hewing off his head, he it presented</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before the feete of the faire Pastorell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, scarcely yet from former feare exempted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thousand times him thankt that had her death prevented.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>From that day forth she gan him to affecl:,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And daily more her favour to augment;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Coridon for cowherdize reject,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fit to keepe sheepe, unfit for loves content:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The gentle heart scornes base disparagement.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet Calidore did not despise him quight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But usde him friendly for further intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That by his fellowship he colour might</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both his estate and love from skill of any wight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So well he wood her, and so well he wrought her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With humble service, and with daily sute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That at the last unto his will he brought her;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which he so wisely well did prosecute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That of his love he reapt the timely frute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And joyed long in close felicity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till fortune, fraught with malice, blinde and brute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That envies lovers long prosperity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blew up a bitter storme of foule adversity.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It fortuned one day, when Calidore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was hunting in the woods, (as was his trade)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A lawlesse people, Brigants hight of yore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That never usde to live by plough nor spade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But fed on spoile and booty, which they made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon their neighbours which did nigh them border,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The dwelling of these shepheards did invade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And spoyld their houses, and them selves did murder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And drove away their flocks; with other much disorder.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Amongst the rest, the which they then did pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They spoyld old Melibee of all he had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all his people captive led away;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mongst which this lucklesse mayd away was lad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Faire Pastorella, sorrowfull and sad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Most sorrowfull, most sad, that ever sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now made the spoile of theeves and Brigants bad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which was the conquest of the gentlest Knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ever liv’d, and th’onely glory of his might.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With them also was taken Coridon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And carried captive by those theeves away;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who in the covert of the night, that none</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mote them descry, nor reskue from their pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto their dwelling did them close convay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their dwelling in a little Island was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Covered with shrubby woods, in which no way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Appeard for people in nor out to pas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor any footing fynde for overgrowen gras:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For underneath the ground their way was made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through hollow caves, that no man mote discover</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the thicke shrubs, which did them alwaies shade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From view of living wight and covered over;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But darkenesse dred and daily night did hover</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through all the inner parts, wherein they dwelt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne lightned was with window, nor with lover,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But with continuall candle-light, which delt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A doubtfull sense of things, not so well scene as felt.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Hither those Brigants brought their present pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And kept them with continuall watch and ward;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Meaning, so soone as they convenient may,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For slaves to sell them for no small reward</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To Merchants, which them kept in bondage hard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or sold againe. Now when faire Pastorell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into this place was brought, and kept with gard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of griesly theeves, she thought her self in hell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where with such damned fiends she should in darknesse dwell.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But for to tell the dolefull dreriment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And pittifull complaints which there she made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where day and night she nought did but lament</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her wretched life shut up in deadly shade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And waste her goodly beauty, which did fade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like to a flowre that feeles no heate of sunne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which may her feeble leaves with comfort glade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And what befell her in that theevish wonne,</span>

					<span class="i1">That worldly chaunces doe amongst them cast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would be on earth too great a blessednesse,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A thousand sowres hath tempred with one sweet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make it seeme more deare and dainty, as is meet.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like as is now befalne to this faire Mayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Faire Pastorell, of whom is now my song:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who being now in dreadfull darknesse layd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Amongst those theeves, which her in bondage strong</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Detaynd, yet Fortune, not with all this wrong</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Contented, greater mischiefe on her threw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sorrowes heapt on her in greater throng;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That who so heares her heavinesse, would rew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pitty her sad plight, so chang’d from pleasaunt hew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whylest thus she in these hellish dens remayned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wrapped in wretched cares and hearts unrest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It so befell, (as Fortune had ordayned)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he which was their Capitaine profest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And had the chiefe commaund of all the rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One day, as he did all his prisoners vew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With lustfull eyes beheld that lovely guest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Faire Pastorella, whose sad mournefull hew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like the faire Morning clad in misty fog did shew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At sight whereof his barbarous heart was fired,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And inly burnt with flames most raging whot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That her alone he for his part desired</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all the other pray which they had got,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And her in mynde did to him selfe allot.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From that day forth he kyndnesse to her showed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sought her love by all the meanes he mote;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With looks, with words, with gifts he oft her wowed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And mixed threats among, and much unto her vowed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But all that ever he could doe or say</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her constant mynd could not a whit remove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor draw unto the lure of his lewd lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To graunt him favour or afford him love:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet ceast he not to sew, and all waies prove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By which he mote accomplish his request,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying and doing all that mote behove;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne day nor night he suffred her to rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But her all night did watch, and all the day molest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At last, when him she so importune saw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fearing least he at length the raines would lend</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto his lust, and make his will his law,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sith in his powre she was to foe or frend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She thought it best, for shadow to pretend</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some shew of favour, by him gracing small,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That she thereby mote either freely wend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or at more ease continue there his thrall:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A little well is lent that gaineth more withall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So from thenceforth, when love he to her made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With better tearmes she did him entertaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which gave him hope, and did him halfe perswade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he in time her joyance should obtaine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when she saw through that small favours gaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That further then she willing was he prest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She found no meanes to barre him, but to faine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A sodaine sickenesse which her sore opprest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And made unfit to serve his lawlesse mindes behest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>By meanes whereof she would not him permit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Once to approch to her in privity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But onely mongst the rest by her to sit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mourning the rigour of her malady,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And seeking all things meete for remedy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But she resolv’d no remedy to fynde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor better cheare to shew in misery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till Fortune would her captive bonds unbynde:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her sickenesse was not of the body, but the mynde.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>During which space that she thus sicke did lie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It chaunst a sort of merchants, which were wount</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To skim those coastes for bondmen there to buy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by such trafficke after gaines to hunt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Arrived in this Isle, though bare and blunt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">T’inquire for slaves; where being readie met</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By some of these same theeves at the instant brunt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were brought unto their Captaine, who was set</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By his faire patients side with sorrowfull regret.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To whom they shewed, how those marchants were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Arriv’d in place their bondslaves for to buy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And therefore prayd that those same captives there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mote to them for their most commodity</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be sold, and mongst them shared equally.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This their request the Captaine much appalled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet could he not their just demaund deny,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And willed streight the slaves should forth be called,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sold for most advantage, not to be forstalled.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then forth the good old Meliboe was brought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Coridon with many other moe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom they before in diverse spoyles had caught;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All which he to the marchants sale did showe:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till some, which did the sundry prisoners knowe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gan to inquire for that faire shepherdesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which with the rest they tooke not long agoe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gan her forme and feature to expresse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The more t’augment her price through praise of comlinesse.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To whom the Captaine in full angry wize</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made answere, that the mayd of whom they spake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was his owne purchase and his onely prize;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which none had to doe, ne ought partake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he himselfe which did that conquest make:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Litle for him to have one silly lasse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Besides, through sicknesse now so wan and weake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That nothing meet in merchandise to passe:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So shew’d them her, to prove how pale and weake she was.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The sight of whom, though now decayd and mard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke but hardly scene by candle-light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet, like a Diamond of rich regard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In doubtfull shadow of the darkesome night</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With starrie beames about her shining bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These marchants fixed eyes did so amaze,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That what through wonder, and what through delight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A while on her they greedily did gaze,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And did her greatly like, and did her greatly praize.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At last when all the rest them offred were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And prises to them placed at their pleasure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They all refused in regard of her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ought would buy, how ever prisd with measure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Withouten her, whose worth above all threasure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They did esteeme, and offred store of gold:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But then the Captaine, fraught with more displeasure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bad them be still; his love should not be sold;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rest take if they would; he her to him would hold.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Therewith some other of the chiefest theeves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Boldly him bad such injurie forbeare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For that same mayd, how ever it him greeves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should with the rest be sold before him theare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To make the prises of the rest more deare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with great rage he stoutly doth denay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, fiercely drawing forth his blade, doth sweare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That who so hardie hand on her doth lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It dearely shall aby, and death for handsell pay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus, as they words amongst them multiply,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They fall to strokes, the frute of too much talke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the mad steele about doth fiercely fly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not sparing wight, ne leaving any balke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But making way for death at large to walke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, in the horror of the griesly night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In thousand dreadful shapes doth mongst them stalke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And makes huge havocke; whiles the candle-light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out quenched leaves no skill nor difference of wight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like a sort of hungry dogs, ymet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">About some carcase by the common way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doe fall together, stryving each to get</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The greatest portion of the greedie pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All on confused heapes themselves assay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And snatch, and byte, and rend, and tug, and teare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That who them sees would wonder at their fray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And who sees not would be affrayd to heare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such was the conflict of those cruell Brigants there.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But first of all their captives they doe kill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Least they should joyne against the weaker side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or rise against the remnant at their will:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Old Meliboe is slaine; and him beside</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His aged wife, with many others wide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Coridon, escaping craftily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Creepes forth of dores, whilst darknes him doth hide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And flyes away as fast as he can hye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne stayeth leave to take before his friends doe dye.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Pastorella, wofull wretched Elfe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was by the Captaine all this while defended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, minding more her safety then himselfe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His target alwayes over her pretended;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By means whereof, that mote not be amended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He at the length was slaine and layd on ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet holding fast twixt both his armes extended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fayre Pastorell, who, with the selfe same wound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Launcht through the arme, fell down with him in drerie swound.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There lay she covered with confused preasse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of carcases, which dying on her fell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tho, when as he was dead, the fray gan ceasse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And each to other calling did compell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To stay their cruell hands from slaughter fell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sith they that were the cause of all were gone:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereto they all attonce agreed well;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, lighting candles new, gan search anone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How many of their friends were slaine, how many fone.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Their Captaine there they cruelly found kild,</span>

					<span class="i1">And in his armes the dreary dying mayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like a sweet Angell twixt two clouds uphild;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her lovely light was dimmed and decayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With cloud of death upon her eyes displayd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet did the cloud make even that dimmed light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeme much more lovely in that darknesse layd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And twixt the twinckling of her eye-lids bright</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To sparke out litle beames, like starres in foggie night.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But when they mov’d the carcases aside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They found that life did yet in her remaine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then all their helpes they busily applyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To call the soule backe to her home againe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wrought so well, with labour and long paine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That they to life recovered her at last:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, sighing sore, as if her hart in twaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had riven bene and all her hart-strings brast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With drearie drouping eyne lookt up like one aghast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There she beheld, that sore her griev’d to see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her father and her friends about her lying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her selfe sole left a second spoyle to bee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of those, that, having saved her from dying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Renew’d her death by timely death denying.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What now is left her but to wayle and weepe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wringing her hands, and ruefully loud crying?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne cared she her wound in teares to steepe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Albe with all their might those Brigants her did keepe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But when they saw her now reliv’d againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They left her so, in charge of one, the best</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of many worst, who with unkind disdaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And cruell rigour her did much molest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Scarse yeelding her due food or timely rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And scarsely suffring her infestred wound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That sore her payn’d, by any to be drest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So leave we her in wretched thraldome bound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And turne we backe to Calidore where we him found.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who when he backe returned from the wood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And saw his shepheards cottage spoyled quight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And his love reft away, he wexed wood</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And halfe enraged at that ruefull sight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That even his hart, for very fell despight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And his owne flesh he readie was to teare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He chauft, he griev’d, he fretted, and he sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fared like a furious wyld Beare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose whelpes are stolne away, she being otherwhere.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ne wight he found to whom he might complaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne wight he found of whom he might inquire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That more increast the anguish of his paine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He sought the woods, but no man could see there;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He sought the plaines, but could no tydings heare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The woods did nought but ecchoes vaine rebound;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The playnes all waste and emptie did appeare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where wont the shepheards oft their pypes resound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And feed an hundred flocks, there now not one he found.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At last, as there he romed up and downe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He chaunst one comming towards him to spy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That seem’d to be some sorie simple clowne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With ragged weedes, and lockes upstaring hye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if he did from some late daunger fly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And yet his feare did follow him behynd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who as he unto him approched nye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He mote perceive by signes which he did fynd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Coridon it was, the silly shepherds hynd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tho, to him running fast, he did not stay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To greet him first, but askt where were the rest?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where Pastorell? Who full of fresh dismay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gushing forth in teares, was so opprest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he no word could speake, but smit his brest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And up to heaven his eyes fast-streming threw:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat the knight amaz’d yet did not rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But askt againe, what ment that rufull hew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where was his Pastorell? where all the other crew?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Ah, well-away!” (sayd he, then sighing sore)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“That ever I did live this day to see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This dismall day, and was not dead before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before I saw faire Pastorella dye.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Die? out alas!” then Calidore did cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“How could the death dare ever her to quell?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But read thou, shepheard, read what destiny</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or other dyrefull hap from heaven or hell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath wrought this wicked deed: doe feare away, and tell.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tho, when the Shepheard breathed had a-while,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He thus began: “Where shall I then commence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This wofull tale? or how those Brigants vyle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With cruell rage and dreadfull violence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Spoyld all our cots, and caried us from hence;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or how faire Pastorell should have bene sold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To marchants, but was sav’d with strong defence;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or how those theeves, whilest one sought her to hold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fell all at ods, and fought through fury fierce and bold.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“In that same conflict (woe is me!) befell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This fatall chaunce, this dolefull accident,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose heavy tydings now I have to tell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">First all the captives, which they here had hent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were by them slaine by generall consent:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Old Meliboe and his good wife withall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These eyes saw die, and dearely did lament;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, when the lot to Pastorell did fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their Captaine long withstood, and did her death forstall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But what could he gainst all them doe alone?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It could not boot: needs mote she die at last.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I onely scapt through great confusione</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of cryes and clamors which amongst them past,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In dreadfull darknesse dreadfully aghast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That better were with them to have bene dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then here to see all desolate and wast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Despoyled of those joyes and jolly-head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which with those gentle shepherds here I wont to lead.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When Calidore these ruefull newes had raught,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His hart quite deaded was with anguish great,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all his wits with doole were nigh distraught,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he his face, his head, his Brest did beat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And death it selfe unto himselfe did threat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Oft cursing th’ heavens, that so cruell were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To her, whose name he often did repeat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wishing oft that he were present there</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When she was slaine, or had bene to her succour nere.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But after griefe awhile had had his course,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And spent it selfe in mourning, he at last</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began to mitigate his swelling sourse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in his mind with better reason cast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How he might save her life, if life did last;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or, if that dead, how he her death might wreake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sith otherwise he could not mend thing past;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or if it to revenge he were too weake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then for to die with her, and his lives threed to breake.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tho Coridon he prayd, sith he well knew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The readie way unto that theevish wonne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To wend with him, and be his conduct trew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the place, to see what should be donne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he, whose hart through feare was late fordonne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would not for ought be drawne to former drede,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But by all meanes the daunger knowne did shonne:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet Calidore so well him wrought with meed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And faire bespoke with words, that he at last agreed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So forth they goe together (God before)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both clad in shepheards weeds agreeably,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And both with shepheards hookes: But Calidore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had, underneath, him armed privily.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tho, to the place when they approched nye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They chaunst, upon an hill not farre away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some flockes of sheepe and shepheards to espy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom they both agreed to take their way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In hope there newes to learne, how they mote best assay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There did they find, that which they did not feare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The selfe same flocks the which those theeves had reft</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From Melibce and from themselves whyleare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And certaine of the theeves there by them left,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which, for want of beards, themselves then kept.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Right well knew Coridon his owne late sheepe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And seeing them for tender pittie wept;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when he saw the theeves which did them keepe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His hart gan fayle, albe he saw them all a-sleepe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Calidore recomforting his griefe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Though not his feare, for nought may feare disswade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him hardly forward drew, whereas the thiefe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lay sleeping soundly in the bushes shade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom Coridon him counseld to invade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now all unwares, and take the spoyle away;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he, that in his mind had closely made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A further purpose, would not so them slay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But gently waking them gave them the time of day.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tho, sitting downe by them upon the greene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of sundrie things he purpose gan to faine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he by them might certaine tydings weene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Pastorell, were she alive or slaine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mongst which the theeves them questioned againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What mister men, and eke from whence they were:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom they aunswer’d, as did appertaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That they were poore heardgroomes, the which whylere</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had from their maisters fled, and now sought hyre elswhere.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whereof right glad they seem’d, and offer made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To hyre them well if they their flockes would keepe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For they themselves were evill groomes, they sayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unwont with heards to watch, or pasture sheepe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But to forray the land, or secure the deepe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereto they soone agreed, and earnest tooke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To keepe their flockes for litle hyre and chepe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For they for better hyre did shortly looke:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So there all day they bode, till light the sky forsooke.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tho, when as towards darksome night it drew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto their hellish dens those theeves them brought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where shortly they in great acquaintance grew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the secrets of their entrayles sought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There did they find, contrarie to their thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Pastorell yet liv’d; but all the rest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were dead, right so as Coridon had taught:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereof they both full glad and blyth did rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But chiefly Calidore, whom griefe had most possest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At length, when they occasion fittest found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In dead of night, when all the theeves did rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After a late forray, and slept full sound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sir Calidore him arm’d as he thought best,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Having of late by diligent inquest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Provided him a sword of meanest sort;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which he streight went to the Captaines nest:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Coridon durst not with him consort,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne durst abide behind, for dread of worse effort.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When to the Cave they came, they found it fast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Calidore with huge resistlesse might</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The dores assayled, and the locks upbrast:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With noyse whereof the theefe awaking light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the entrance ran; where the bold knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Encountring him with small resistence slew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whiles faire Pastorell through great affright</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was almost dead, misdoubting least of-new</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some uprore were like that which lately she did vew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But when as Calidore was comen in,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gan aloud for Pastorell to call,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Knowing his voice, although not heard long sin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She sudden was revived therewithall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wondrous joy felt in her spirits thrall:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like him that being long in tempest tost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Looking each houre into deathes mouth to fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At length espyes at hand the happie cost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On which he safety hopes that earst feard to be lost.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Her gentle hart, that now long season past</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had never joyance felt nor chearefull thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began some smacke of comfort new to tast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like lyfull heat to nummed senses brought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And life to feele that long for death had sought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne lesse in hart rejoyced Calidore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When he her found; but, like to one distraught</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And robd of reason, towards her him bore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thousand times embrast, and kist a thousand more.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But now by this, with noyse of late uprore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The hue and cry was raysed all about;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the Brigants flocking in great store</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the cave gan preasse, nought having dout</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that was doen, and entred in a rout:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Calidore in th’entry close did stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And entertayning them with courage stout,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still slew the formost that came first to hand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So long till all the entry was with bodies mand.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tho, when no more could nigh to him approch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He breath’d his sword, and rested him till day;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which when he spyde upon the earth t’encroch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through the dead carcases he made his way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mongst which he found a sword of better say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which he forth went into th’open light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where all the rest for him did readie stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, fierce assayling him, with all their might</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gan all upon him lay: there gan a dreadfull fight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>How many flyes, in whottest sommers day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do seize upon some beast whose flesh is bare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all the place with swarmes do overlay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with their litle stings right felly fare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So many theeves about him swarming are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All which do him assayle on every side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sore oppresse, ne any him doth spare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he doth with his raging brond divide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their thickest troups, and round about him scattreth wide.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like as a Lion mongst an heard of dere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Disperseth them to catch his choysest pray;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So did he fly amongst them here and there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all that nere him came did hew and slay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till he had strowd with bodies all the way;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That none his daunger daring to abide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fled from his wrath, and did themselves convay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into their caves, their heads from death to hide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne any left that viclorie to him envide.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then, backe returning to his dearest deare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He her gah to recomfort all he might</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With gladfull speaches and with lovely cheare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And forth her bringing to the joyous light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereof she long had lackt the wishfull sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Deviz’d all goodly meanes from her to drive</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sad remembrance of her wretched plight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So her uneath at last he did revive</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That long had lyen dead, and made again alive.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This doen, into those theevish dens he went,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thence did all the spoyles and threasures take,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which they from many long had robd and rent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But fortune now the victors meed did make:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which the best he did his love betake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And also all those flockes, which they before</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had reft from Melibce and from his make,</span>

					<span>Like as a ship, that through the Ocean wyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Directs her course unto one certaine cost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is met of many a counter winde and tyde,</span>

				</p>

					<span>For all that hetherto hath long delayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This gentle knight from sewing his first quest,</span>

					<span class="i1">To shew the courtesie by him profest</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To his atchievement of the Blatant Beast:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who all this while at will did range and raine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whilst none was him to stop, nor none him to restraine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sir Calidore, when thus he now had raught</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Faire Pastorella from those Brigants powre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the Castle of Belgard her brought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereof was Lord the good Sir Bellamoure;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who whylome was, in his youthes freshest flowre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A lustie knight as ever wielded speare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And had endured many a dreadfull stoure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In bloudy battell for a Ladie deare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fayrest Ladie then of all that living were:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Her name was Claribell; whose father hight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Lord of Many Hands, farre renound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For his great riches and his greater might:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He, through the wealth wherein he did abound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This daughter thought in wedlocke to have bound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the Prince of Picleland, bordering nere;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But she, whose sides before with secret wound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of love to Bellamoure empierced were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By all meanes shund to match with any forrein fere.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And Bellamour againe so well her pleased</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With dayly service and attendance dew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That of her love he was entyrely seized,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And closely did her wed, but knowne to few:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which when her father understood, he grew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In so great rage that them in dongeon deepe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without compassion cruelly he threw;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet did so streightly them asunder keepe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That neither could to company of th’other creepe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nathlesse Sir Bellamour, whether through grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or secret guifts, so with his keepers wrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That to his love sometimes he came in place;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereof her wombe, unwist to wight, was fraught,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in dew time a mayden child forth brought:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which she streightway, (for dread least if her syre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should know thereof to slay he would have sought,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Delivered to her handmayd, that for hyre</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She should it cause be fostred under straunge attyre.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The trustie damzell bearing it abrode</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the emptie fields, where living wight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mote not bewray the secret of her lode,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She forth gan lay unto the open light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The litle babe, to take thereof a sight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom whylest she did with watrie eyne behold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the litle brest, like christall bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She mote perceive a litle purple mold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That like a rose her silken leaves did faire unfold.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Well she it markt, and pittied the more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet could not remedie her wretched case;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, closing it againe like as before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bedeaw’d with teares there left it in the place:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet left not quite, but drew a litle space</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behind the bushes, where she did her hyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To weet what mortall hand, or heavens grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would for the wretched infants helpe provyde;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which it loudly cald, and pittifully cryde.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At length a Shepheard, which there by did keepe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His fleecie flock upon the playnes around,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Led with the infants cry that loud did weepe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came to the place; where, when he wrapped found</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Th’abandond spoyle, he softly it unbound;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, seeing there that did him pittie sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He tooke it up and in his mantle wound;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So home unto his honest wife it bore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who as her owne it nurst (and named) evermore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus long continu’d Claribell a thrall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Bellamour in bands; till that her syre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Departed life, and left unto them all:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then all the stormes of fortunes former yre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were turnd, and they to freedome did retyre.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thenceforth they joy’d in happinesse together,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And lived long in peace and love entyre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without disquiet or dislike of ether,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till time that Calidore brought Pastorella thether.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Both whom they goodly well did entertaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For Bellamour knew Calidore right well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And loved for his prowesse, sith they twaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Long since had fought in field: Als Claribell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne lesse did tender the faire Pastorell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeing her weake and wan through durance long.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There they a while together thus did dwell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In much delight, and many joyes among,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Untill the Damzell gan to wex more sound and strong.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tho gan Sir Calidore him to advize</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his first quest, which he had long forlore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Asham’d to thinke how he that enterprize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which the Faery Queene had long afore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bequeath’d to him, forslacked had so sore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That much he feared least reprochfull blame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With foule dishonour him mote blot therefore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Besides the losse of so much loos and fame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As through the world thereby should glorifie his name.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Therefore, resolving to returne in hast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto so great atchievement, he bethought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To leave his love, now perill being past,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With Claribell; whylest he that monster sought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Throughout the world, and to destruction brought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So taking leave of his faire Pastorell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom to recomfort all the meanes he wrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With thanks to Bellamour and Claribell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He went forth on his quest, and did that him befell.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But first, ere I doe his adventures tell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In this exploite, me needeth to declare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What did betide to the faire Pastorell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">During his absence, left in heavy care</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through daily mourning and nightly misfare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet did that auncient matrone all she might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To cherish her with all things choice and rare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And her owne handmayd, that Melissa hight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Appointed to attend her dewly day and night.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who in a morning, when this Maiden faire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was dighting her, having her snowy Brest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As yet not laced, nor her golden haire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into their comely tresses dewly drest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Chaunst to espy upon her yvory chest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The rosie marke, which she remembred well</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That litle Infant had, which forth she kest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The daughter of her Lady Claribell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The which she bore the whiles in prison she did dwell.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which well avizing, streight she gan to cast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In her conceiptfull mynd that this faire Mayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was that same infant, which so long sith past</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She in the open fields had loosely layd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To fortunes spoile, unable it to ayd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So, full of joy, streight forth she ran in hast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto her mistresse, being halfe dismayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To tell her how the heavens had her graste</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To save her chylde, which in misfortunes mouth was plaste.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The sober mother seeing such her mood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet knowing not what meant that sodaine thro,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Askt her, how mote her words be understood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And what the matter was that mov’d her so?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“My liefe,” (sayd she) “ye know that long ygo,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whilest ye in durance dwelt, ye to me gave</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A little mayde, the which ye chylded tho;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The same againe if now ye list to have,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The same is yonder Lady, whom high God did save.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Much was the Lady troubled at that speach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gan to question streight, how she it knew?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Most certaine markes” (sayd she) “do me it teach;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For on her brest I with these eyes did view</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The litle purple rose which thereon grew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereof her name ye then to her did give.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Besides, her countenaunce and her likely hew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Matched with equall years, do surely prieve</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That yond same is your daughter sure, which yet doth live.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The matrone stayd no lenger to enquire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But forth in hast ran to the straunger Mayd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom catching greedily, for great desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rent up her brest, and bosome open layd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which that rose she plainely saw displayd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then, her embracing twixt her armes twaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She long so held, and softly weeping sayd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“And livest thou, my daughter, now againe?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And art thou yet alive, whom dead I long did faine?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tho further asking her of sundry things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And times comparing with their accidents,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She found at last, by very certaine signes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And speaking markes of passed monuments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That this young Mayd, whom chance to her presents,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is her owne daughter, her owne infant deare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tho, wondring long at those so straunge events,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A thousand times she her embraced nere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With many a joyfull kisse and many a melting teare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who ever is the mother of one chylde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which having thought long dead she fyndes alive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let her by proofe of that which she hath fylde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In her owne breast, this mothers joy descrive;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For other none such passion can contrive</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In perfect forme, as this good Lady felt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When she so faire a daughter saw survive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As Pastorella was, that nigh she swelt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For passing joy, which did all into pitty melt.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thence running forth unto her loved Lord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She unto him recounted all that fell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, joyning joy with her in one accord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Acknowledg’d for his owne faire Pastorell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There leave we them in joy, and let us tell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Calidore; who, seeking all this while</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That monstrous Beast by finall force to quell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through every place with restlesse paine and toile</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Him follow’d by the tract of his outragious spoile.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Through all estates he found that he had past,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which he many massacres had left,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to the Clergy now was come at last;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which such spoile, such havocke, and such theft</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He wrought, that thence all goodnesse he bereft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That endlesse were to tell. The Elfin Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who now no place besides unsought had left,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At length into a Monastere did light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where he him found despoyling all with maine and might.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Into their cloysters now he broken had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through which the Monckes he chaced here and there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And them pursu’d into their dortours sad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And searched all their eels and secrets neare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which what filth and ordure did appeare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were yrkesome to report; yet that foule Beast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nought sparing them, the more did tosse and teare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ransacke all their dennes from most to least,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Regarding nought religion, nor their holy heast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>From thence into the sacred Church he broke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And robd the Chancell, and the deskes downe threw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Altars fouled, and blasphemy spoke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And th’ Images, for all their goodly hew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did cast to ground, whilest none was them to rew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So all confounded and disordered there:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, seeing Calidore, away he flew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Knowing his fatall hand by former feare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he him fast pursuing soone approched neare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Him in a narrow place he overtooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fierce assailing forst him turne againe:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sternely he turnd againe, when he him strooke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With his sharpe steele, and ran at him amaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With open mouth, that seemed to containe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A full good pecke within the utmost brim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All set with yron teeth in raunges twaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That terrifide his foes, and armed him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Appearing like the mouth of Orcus griesly grim:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And therein were a thousand tongs empight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of sundry kindes and sundry quality;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some were of dogs, that barked day and night;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And some of cats, that wrawling still did cry;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And some of Beares, that groynd continually;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And some of Tygres, that did seeme to gren</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And snar at all that ever passed by:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But most of them were tongues of mortall men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which spake reprochfully, not caring where nor when.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And them amongst were mingled here and there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The tongues of Serpents, with three forked stings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That spat out poyson, and gore-bloudy gere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At all that came within his ravenings;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And spake licentious words and hatefull things</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of good and bad alike, of low and hie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne Kesars spared he a whit, nor Kings;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But either blotted them with infamie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or bit them with his banefull teeth of injury.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Calidore, thereof no whit afrayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rencountred him with so impetuous might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That th’outrage of his violence he stayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And bet abacke, threatning in vaine to bite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And spitting forth the poyson of his spight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That fomed all about his bloody jawes:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tho, rearing up his former feete on hight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He rampt upon him with his ravenous pawes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if he would have rent him with his cruell clawes</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But he, right well aware, his rage to ward</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did cast his shield atweene; and, therewithall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Putting his puissaunce forth, pursu’d so hard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That backeward he enforced him to fall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, being downe, ere he new helpe could call,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His shield he on him threw, and fast downe held:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like as a bullocke, that in bloudy stall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of butchers balefull hand to ground is feld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is forcibly kept downe, till he be throughly queld.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Full cruelly the Beast did rage and rore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be downe held, and maystred so with might,</span>
					<br/>
