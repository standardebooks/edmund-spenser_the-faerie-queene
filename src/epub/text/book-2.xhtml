					<span>Right well I wote, most mighty Soveraine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all this famous antique history</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of some th’aboundance of an ydle braine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will judged be, and painted forgery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rather then matter of just memory,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sith none that breatheth living aire does know</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where is that happy land of Faery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which I so much doe vaunt, yet no where show,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But vouch antiquities, which no body can know.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But let that man with better sence advize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That of the world least part to us is red;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And daily how, through hardy enterprize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Many great Regions are discovered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which to late age were never mentioned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who ever heard of th’Indian Peru?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or who in venturous vessell measured</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Amazon huge river, now found trew?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or fruitfullest Virginia who did ever vew?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet all these were, when no man did them know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet have from wisest ages hidden beene;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And later times thinges more unknowne shall show.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Why then should witlesse man so much misweene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That nothing is but that which he hath seene?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What if within the Moones fayre shining spheare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What if in every other starre unseene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of other worldes he happily should heare,</span>

					<span>He wonder would much more; yet such to some appeare.</span>

					<span>Of Faery lond yet if he more inquyre,</span>

					<span class="i1">Where she enjoyes sure peace for evermore,</span>

					<span class="i1">And deadly food he makes: him to offend,</span>

					<span class="i1">By forged treason or by open fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He seekes, of all his drifte the aymed end:</span>

					<span>For hardly could bee hurt who was already stong.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Still as he went he craftie stales did lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With cunning traynes him to entrap unwares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And privy spyals plast in all his way,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To ketch him at a vauntage in his snares.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But now so wise and wary was the knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By tryall of his former harmes and cares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he descryde and shonned still his slight:</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nath’lesse th’Enchaunter would not spare his payne,</span>

					<span class="i1">In hope to win occasion to his will;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which when he long awaited had in vayne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He chaungd his mynd from one to other ill;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For to all good he enimy was still.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the way him fortuned to meete,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fayre marching underneath a shady hill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A goodly knight, all armd in harnesse meete,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That from his head no place appeared to his feete.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His carriage was full comely and upright;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His countenance demure and temperate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But yett so sterne and terrible in sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That cheard his friendes, and did his foes amate:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He was an Elfin borne of noble state</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And mickle worship in his native land;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well could he tourney, and in lists debate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And knighthood tooke of good Sir Huons hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When with king Oberon he came to Faery land.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Him als accompanyd upon the way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A comely Palmer, clad in black attyre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of rypest yeares, and heares all hoarie gray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with a staffe his feeble steps did stire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Least his long way his aged limbes should tire:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, if by lookes one may the mind aread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He seemd to be a sage and sober syre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ever with slow pace the knight did lead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who taught his trampling steed with equall steps to tread.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Such whenas Archimago them did view,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He weened well to worke some uncouth wyle:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eftsoones untwisting his deceiptfull clew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He gan to weave a web of wicked guyle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, with faire countenance and flattring style</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To them approching, thus the knight bespake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Fayre sonne of Mars, that seeke with warlike spoyle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And great atchiev’ments, great your selfe to make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vouchsafe to stay your steed for humble misers sake.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He stayd his steed for humble misers sake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And badd tell on the tenor of his playnt:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who feigning then in every limb to quake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through inward feare, and seeming pale and faynt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With piteous mone his percing speach gan paynt:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Deare Lady! how shall I declare thy cace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom late I left in languorous constraynt?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would God! thy selfe now present were in place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To tell this ruefull tale: thy sight could win thee grace.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Or rather would, O! would it so had chaunst,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That you, most noble Sir, had present beene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When that lewd rybauld, with vyle lust advaunst,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Laid first his filthie hands on virgin cleene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To spoyle her dainty corps, so faire and sheene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As on the earth, great mother of us all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With living eye more fayre was never seene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of chastity and honour virginall:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Witnes, ye heavens, whom she in vaine to help did call.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“How may it be,” sayd then the knight halfe wroth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“That knight should knighthood ever so have shent?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“None but that saw,” (quoth he) “would weene for troth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How shamefully that Mayd he did torment:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her looser golden lockes he rudely rent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And drew her on the ground; and his sharpe sword</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against her snowy brest he fiercely bent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And threatned death with many a bloodie word</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tounge hates to tell the rest that eye to see abhord.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Therewith amoved from his sober mood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“And lives he yet,” (said he) “that wrought this act?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And doen the heavens afford him vitall food?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“He lives,” (quoth he) “and boasteth of the fact,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne yet hath any knight his courage crackt.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Where may that treachour then,” (sayd he) “be found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or by what meanes may I his footing tract?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“That shall I shew,” (sayd he) “as sure as hound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The stricken Deare doth chalenge by the bleeding wound.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He stayd not lenger talke, but with fierce yre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And zealous haste away is quickly gone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To seeke that knight, where him that crafty Squyre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Supposd to be. They do arrive anone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where sate a gentle Lady all alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With garments rent, and heare discheveled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wringing her handes, and making piteous mone:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her swollen eyes were much disfigured,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And her faire face with teares was fowly blubbered.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The knight, approching nigh, thus to her said:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Fayre Lady, through fowle sorrow ill bedight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Great pitty is to see you thus dismayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And marre the blossom of your beauty bright:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forthy appease your griefe and heavy plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And tell the cause of your conceived payne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For, if he live that hath you doen despight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He shall you doe dew recompence agayne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or els his wrong with greater puissance maintaine.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when she heard, as in despightfull wise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She wilfully her sorrow did augment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And offred hope of comfort did despise:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her golden lockes most cruelly she rent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And scratcht her face with ghastly dreriment;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne would she speake, ne see, ne yet be seene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But hid her visage, and her head downe bent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Either for grievous shame, or for great teene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if her hart with sorrow had transfixed beene:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Till her that Squyre bespake: “Madame, my liefe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For Gods deare love be not so wilfull bent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But doe vouchsafe now to receive reliefe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which good fortune doth to you present.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For what bootes it to weepe and to wayment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When ill is chaunst, but doth the ill increase,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the weake minde with double woe torment?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When she her Squyre heard speake, she gan appease</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her voluntarie paine, and feele some secret ease.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Eftsoone she said; “Ah! gentle trustie Squyre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What comfort can I, wofull wretch, conceave?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or why should ever I henceforth desyre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see faire heavens face, and life not leave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sith that false Traytour did my honour reave?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“False traytour certes,” (saide the Faerie knight)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“I read the man, that ever would deceave</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A gentle Lady, or her wrong through might:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Death were too litle paine for such a fowle despight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But now, fayre Lady, comfort to you make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And read who hath ye wrought this shamefull plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That short revenge the man may overtake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereso he be, and soone upon him light.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Certes,” (saide she) “I wote not how he hight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But under him a gray steede he did wield,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose sides with dapled circles weren dight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upright he rode, and in his silver shield</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He bore a bloodie Crosse that quartred all the field.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Now by my head,” (saide Guyon) “much I muse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How that same knight should doe so fowle amis,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or ever gentle Damzell so abuse:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For, may I boldly say, he surely is</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A right good knight, and trew of word ywis:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I present was, and can it witnesse well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When armes he swore, and streight did enterpris</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Th’adventure of the Errant damozell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which he hath great glory wonne, as I heare tell.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Nathlesse he shortly shall againe be tryde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fairely quit him of th’imputed blame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Els, be ye sure, he dearely shall abyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or make you good amendment for the same:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All wrongs have mendes, but no amendes of shame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now therefore, Lady, rise out of your paine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And see the salving of your blotted name.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full loth she seemd thereto, but yet did faine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For she was inly glad her purpose so to gaine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Her purpose was not such as she did faine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne yet her person such as it was seene;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But under simple shew, and semblant plaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lurkt false Duessa secretly unseene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As a chaste Virgin that had wronged beene:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So had false Archimago her disguysd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To cloke her guile with sorrow and sad teene;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke himselfe had craftily devisd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be her Squire, and do her service well aguisd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Her, late forlorne and naked, he had found</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where she did wander in waste wildernesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lurking in rockes and caves far under ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with greene mosse cov’ring her nakednesse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To hide her shame and loathly filthinesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sith her Prince Arthur of proud ornaments</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And borrowd beauty spoyld. Her nathelesse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Th’enchaunter finding fit for his intents</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did thus revest, and deckt with dew habiliments.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For all he did was to deceive good knights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And draw them from pursuit of praise and fame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To slug in slouth and sensuall delights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And end their daies with irrenowmed shame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now exceeding griefe him overcame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see the Redcrosse thus advaunced hye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore this craftie engine he did frame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against his praise to stirre up enmitye</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of such, as vertues like mote unto him allye.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So now he Guyon guydes an uncouth way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through woods and mountaines, till they came at last</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into a pleasant dale that lowly lay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Betwixt two hils, whose high heads overplast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The valley did with coole shade overcast:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through midst thereof a little river rold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By which there sate a knight with helme unlaste,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Himselfe refreshing with the liquid cold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After his travell long and labours manifold.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Who, seeing him from far so fierce to pricke,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And cryde, “Mercie, Sir knight! and mercie, Lord,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But his fierce foe his steed could stay uneath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who, prickt with courage kene, did cruell battell breath.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, when he heard him speake, streight way he knew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His errour; and, himselfe inclyning, sayd:</span>

					<span class="i1">“Ah! deare Sir Guyon, well becommeth you,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So beene they both at one, and doen upreare</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Goodly comportaunce each to other beare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And entertaine themselves with court’sies meet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then said the Redcrosse knight; “Now mote I weet,</span>

					<span>Great cause, I weene, you guided, or some uncouth chaunce.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Certes,” (said he) “well mote I shame to tell</span>

					<span class="i1">A false infamous faitour late befell</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So can he turne his earnest unto game,</span>

					<span class="i1">Through goodly handling and wise temperaunce.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By this his aged Guide in presence came;</span>

					<span class="i1">Must now anew begin like race to ronne.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">God guide thee, Guyon, well to end thy warke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the wished haven bring thy weary barke!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Palmer,” him answered the Redcrosse knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“His be the praise that this atchiev’ment wrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who made my hand the organ of his might:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More then goodwill to me attribute nought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For all I did, I did but as I ought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But you, faire Sir, whose pageant next ensewes,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So courteous conge both did give and take,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With right hands plighted, pledges of good will.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then Guyon forward gan his voyage make</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With his blacke Palmer, that him guided still:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still he him guided over dale and hill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with his steedy staffe did point his way;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His race with reason, and with words his will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From fowle intemperaunce he ofte did stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And suffred not in wrath his hasty steps to stray.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In this faire wize they traveild long yfere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through many hard assayes which did betide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which he honour still away did beare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And spred his glory through all countryes wide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At last, as chaunst them by a forest side</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To passe, for succour from the scorching ray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They heard a ruefull voice, that dearnly cride</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With percing shriekes and many a dolefull lay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which to attend awhile their forward steps they stay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But if that carelesse hevens,” (quoth she) “despise</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet can they not warne death from wretched wight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Come, then; come soone; come sweetest death, to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And take away this long lent loathed light:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sharpe be thy wounds, but sweete the medicines be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That long captived soules from weary thraldome free.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But thou, sweete Babe, whom frowning froward fate</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Loe! I for pledges leave. So give me leave to rest.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that a deadly shrieke she forth did throw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That through the wood re-echoed againe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And after gave a grone so deepe and low</span>

					<span class="i1">That seemd her tender heart was rent in twaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or thrild with point of thorough-piercing paine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As gentle Hynd, whose sides with cruell steele</span>

					<span>Braies out her latest breath, and up her eies doth seele.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when that warriour heard, dismounting straict</span>

					<span class="i1">From his tall steed, he rusht into the thick,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And soone arrived where that sad pourtraict</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of death and dolour lay, halfe dead, halfe quick;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In whose white alabaster brest did stick</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A cruell knife that made a griesly wownd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From which forth gusht a stream of gore blood thick,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all her goodly garments staind arownd,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Pitifull spectacle of deadly smart,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which shee increased with her bleeding hart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the cleane waves with purple gore did ray:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Als in her lap a lovely babe did play</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His cruell sport, in stead of sorrow dew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For in her streaming blood he did embay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His litle hands, and tender joints embrew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pitifull spectacle, as ever eie did vew!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Besides them both, upon the soiled gras</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The dead corse of an armed knight was spred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose armour all with blood besprincled was;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His ruddy lips did smyle, and rosy red</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did paint his chearefull cheekes, yett being ded;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seemd to have beene a goodly personage,</span>

					<span class="i1">Now in his freshest flowre of lustyhed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fitt to inflame faire Lady with loves rage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that fiers fate did crop the blossome of his age.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whom when the good Sir Guyon did behold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His hart gan wexe as starke as marble stone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And his fresh blood did frieze with fearefull cold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all his sences seemd berefte attone:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At last his mighty ghost gan deepe to grone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As Lion, grudging in his great disdaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mournes inwardly, and makes to him selfe mone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Til ruth and fraile affection did constraine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His stout courage to stoupe, and shew his inward paine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Out of her gored wound the cruell steel</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He lightly snatcht, and did the floodgate stop</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With his faire garment; then gan softly feel</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her feeble pulse, to prove if any drop</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of living blood yet in her veynes did hop:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which when he felt to move, he hoped faire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To call backe life to her forsaken shop.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So well he did her deadly wounds repaire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That at the last shee gan to breath out living aire.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which he perceiving greatly gan rejoice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And goodly counsell, that for wounded hart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is meetest med’cine, tempred with sweete voice:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Ay me! deare Lady, which the ymage art</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of ruefull pitty and impatient smart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What direfull chaunce, armd with avenging fate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or cursed hand, hath plaid this cruell part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus fowle to hasten your untimely date?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Speake, O dear Lady, speake! help never comes too late.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Therewith her dim eielids she up gan reare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On which the drery death did sitt as sad</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As lump of lead, and made darke clouds appeare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when as him, all in bright armour clad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before her standing she espied had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As one out of a deadly dreame affright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She weakely started, yet she nothing drad:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Streight downe againe herselfe, in great despight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She groveling threw to ground, as hating life and light.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The gentle knight her soone with carefull paine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uplifted light, and softly did uphold:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thrise he her reard, and thrise she sunck againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till he his armes about her sides gan fold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to her said: “Yet, if the stony cold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have not all seized on your frozen hart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let one word fall that may your grief unfold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And tell the secrete of your mortall smart:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He oft finds present helpe who does his griefe impart.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then, casting up a deadly looke, full low</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shee sight from bottome of her wounded brest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And after, many bitter throbs did throw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With lips full pale and foltring tong opprest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These words she breathed forth from riven chest:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Leave, ah! leave off, whatever wight thou bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To lett a weary wretch from her dew rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And trouble dying soules tranquilitee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Take not away, now got, which none would give to me.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Ah! far be it,” (said he) “Deare dame, fro mee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To hinder soule from her desired rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or hold sad life in long captivitee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For all I seeke is but to have redrest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The bitter pangs that doth your heart infest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tell then, O Lady! tell what fatall priefe</span>

					<span class="i1">Hath with so huge misfortune you opprest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I may cast to compas your reliefe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or die with you in sorrow, and partake your griefe.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With feeble hands then stretched forth on hye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As heven accusing guilty of her death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with dry drops congealed in her eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In these sad wordes she spent her utmost breath:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Heare then, O man! the sorrowes that uneath</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My tong can tell, so far all sence they pas.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Loe! this dead corpse, that lies here underneath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The gentlest knight, that ever on greene gras</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gay steed with spurs did pricke, the good Sir Mortdant was:</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So parted we, and on our journey drive;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till, coming to this well, he stoupt to drincke:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The charme fulfild, dead suddeinly he downe did sincke.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Which when I, wretch”⁠—Not one word more she sayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But breaking off the end for want of breath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And slyding soft, as downe to sleepe her layd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ended all her woe in quiet death.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That seeing, good Sir Guyon could uneath</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From teares abstayne; for griefe his hart did grate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from so heavie sight his head did wreath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Accusing fortune, and too cruell fate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which plonged had faire Lady in so wretched state.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then turning to his Palmer said; “Old syre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behold the ymage of mortalitie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And feeble nature cloth’d with fleshly tyre.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When raging passion with fierce tyranny</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Robs reason of her dew regalitie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And makes it servaunt to her basest part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The strong it weakens with infirmitie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with bold furie armes the weakest hart:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The strong through pleasure soonest falles, the weake through smart.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But temperaunce” (said he) “with golden squire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Betwixt them both can measure out a meane;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nether to melt in pleasures whott desyre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor frye in hartlesse griefe and dolefull tene:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thrise happy man, who fares them both atweene!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But sith this wretched woman overcome</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of anguish, rather then of crime, hath bene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Reserve her cause to her eternall doome;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, in the meane, vouchsafe her honorable toombe.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Palmer,” quoth he, “death is an equall doome</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To good and bad, the common In of rest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But after death the tryall is to come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When best shall bee to them that lived best;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But both alike, when death hath both supprest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Religious reverence doth buriall teene;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which whoso wants, wants so much of his rest:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For all so great shame after death I weene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As selfe to dyen bad, unburied bad to beene.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So both agree their bodies to engrave:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The great earthes wombe they open to the sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with sad Cypresse seemely it embrave;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then, covering with a clod their closed eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They lay therein their corses tenderly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And bid them sleepe in everlasting peace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, ere they did their utmost obsequy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sir Guyon, more affection to increace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bynempt a sacred vow, which none should ay releace.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The dead knights sword out of his sheath he drew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which he cutt a lock of all their heare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which medling with their blood and earth he threw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the grave, and gan devoutly sweare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Such and such evil God on Guyon reare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And worse and worse, young Orphane, be thy payne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If I, or thou, dew vengeaunce doe forbeare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till guiltie blood her guerdon doe obtayne!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So shedding many teares they closd the earth agayne.</span>

					<span>Thus when Sir Guyon with his faithful guyde</span>

					<span class="i1">The end of their sad Tragedie uptyde,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full little weenest thou what sorrowes are</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Left thee for porcion of thy livelyhed;</span>

					<span class="i1">“Ye bene right hard amated, gratious Lord,</span>

					<span class="i1">Whiles cause not well conceived ye mistake:</span>

				<p>

					<span class="i1">By great Dame Nature, from whose fruitfull pap</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their welheads spring, and are with moisture deawd;</span>

					<span class="i1">Or by good prayers, or by other hap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had vertue pourd into their waters bace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thenceforth were renowmd, and sought from place to place.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Such is this well, wrought by occasion straunge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which to her Nymph befell. Upon a day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As she the woodes with bow and shaftes did raunge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The hartlesse Hynd and Robucke to dismay,</span>

					<span class="i1">Inflamed was to follow beauties pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And chaced her that fast from him did fly;</span>

					<span>As hynd from her, so she fled from her enimy.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“At last, when fayling breath began to faint,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And saw no meanes to scape, of shame affrayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She set her downe to weepe for sore constraint;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to Diana calling lowd for ayde,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Welling out streames of teares, and quite dismayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With stony teare of that rude rustick mate,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Lo! now she is that stone; from whose two heads,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As from two weeping eyes, fresh streames do flow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet colde through feare and old conceived dreads;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And yet the stone her semblance seemes to show,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shapt like a maide, that such ye may her know:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And yet her vertues in her water byde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For it is chaste and pure as purest snow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne lets her waves with any filth be dyde;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But ever, like herselfe, unstayned hath beene tryde.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“From thence it comes, that this babes bloody hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">May not be clensd with water of this well:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne certes, Sir, strive you it to withstand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But let them still be bloody, as befell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That they his mothers innocence may tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As she bequeathd in her last testament;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, as a sacred Symbole, it may dwell</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He hearkned to his reason, and the childe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uptaking, to the Palmer gave to beare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But his sad fathers armes with blood defilde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An heavie load, himselfe did lightly reare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And turning to that place, in which whyleare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He left his loftie steed with golden sell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And goodly gorgeous barbes, him found not theare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By other accident, that earst befell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is convaide; but how, or where, here fits not tell.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when Sir Guyon saw, all were he wroth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet algates mote he soft himselfe appease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fairely fare on foot, how ever loth:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His double burden did him sore disease.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So long they traveiled with litle ease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till that at last they to a Castle came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Built on a rocke adjoyning to the seas:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It was an auncient worke of antique fame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wondrous strong by nature, and by skilfull frame.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Therein three sisters dwelt of sundry sort,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The children of one syre by mothers three;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who dying whylome did divide this fort</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To them by equall shares in equall fee:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But stryfull mind and diverse qualitee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drew them in partes, and each made others foe:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still did they strive and daily disagree;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The eldest did against the youngest goe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And both against the middest meant to worken woe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Where when the knight arriv’d, he was right well</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Receiv’d, as knight of so much worth became,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of second sister, who did far excell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The other two: Medina was her name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A sober sad and comely courteous Dame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who rich arayd, and yet in modest guize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In goodly garments that her well became,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fayre marching forth in honorable wize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Him at the threshold mett, and well did enterprize.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She led him up into a goodly bowre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And comely, courted with meet modestie;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne in her speach, ne in her haviour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was lightnesse seene or looser vanitie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But gratious womanhood, and gravitie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above the reason of her youthly yeares.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her golden lockes she roundly did uptye</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In breaded tramels, that no looser heares</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did out of order stray about her daintie eares.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whilest she her selfe thus busily did frame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seemely to entertaine her newcome guest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Newes hereof to her other sisters came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who all this while were at their wanton rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Accourting each her frend with lavish fest:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They were two knights of perelesse puissaunce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And famous far abroad for warlike gest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which to these Ladies love did countenaunce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to his mistresse each himselfe strove to advaunce.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He that made love unto the eldest Dame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was hight Sir Huddibras, an hardy man;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet not so good of deedes as great of name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which he by many rash adventures wan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since errant armes to sew he first began:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More huge in strength then wise in workes he was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And reason with foole-hardize over ran;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sterne melancholy did his courage pas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And was, for terrour more, all armd in shyning bras.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But he that lov’d the youngest was <span xml:lang="fr">Sansloy</span>;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He, that faire Una late fowle outraged,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The most unruly and the boldest boy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ever warlike weapons menaged,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all to lawlesse lust encouraged</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through strong opinion of his matchlesse might;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ought he car’d whom he endamaged</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By tortious wrong, or whom bereav’d of right:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He, now this Ladies Champion, chose for love to fight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>These two gay knights, vowd to so diverse loves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Each other does envy with deadly hate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And daily warre against his foeman moves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In hope to win more favour with his mate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And th’others pleasing service to abate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To magnifie his owne. But when they heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How in that place straunge knight arrived late,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both knightes and ladies forth right angry far’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fercely unto battell sterne themselves prepar’d.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, ere they could proceede unto the place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where he abode, themselves at discord fell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And cruell combat joynd in middle space:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With horrible assault, and fury fell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They heapt huge strokes the scorned life to quell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all on uprore from her settled seat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The house was raysd, and all that in did dwell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seemd that lowde thunder with amazement great</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did rend the ratling skyes with flames of fouldring heat.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The noyse thereof cal’d forth that straunger knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To weet what dreadfull thing was there in hond;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where whenas two brave knightes in bloody fight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With deadly rancour he enraunged fond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His sunbroad shield about his wrest he bond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And shyning blade unsheathd, with which he ran</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto that stead, their strife to understond;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And at his first arrivall them began</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With goodly meanes to pacifie, well as he can.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But they, him spying, both with greedy forse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Attonce upon him ran, and him beset</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With strokes of mortall steele without remorse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on his shield like yron sledges bet:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As when a Beare and Tygre, being met</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In cruell fight on Lybicke Ocean wide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Espye a traveiler with feet surbet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom they in equall pray hope to divide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They stint their strife and him assayle on everie side.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But he, not like a weary traveilere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their sharp assault right boldly did rebut,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And suffred not their blowes to byte him nere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But with redoubled buffes them backe did put:</span>

					<span class="i1">Whose grieved mindes, which choler did englut,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against themselves turning their wrathfull spight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gan with new rage their shieldes to hew and cut;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But still, when Guyon came to part their fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With heavie load on him they freshly gan to smight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As a tall ship tossed in troublous seas,</span>

					<span class="i1">That her on either side doe sore assay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And boast to swallow her in greedy grave;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shee, scorning both their spights, does make wide way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with her brest breaking the fomy wave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Does ride on both their backs, and faire her self doth save.</span>

					<span>So boldly he him beares, and rusheth forth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Betweene them both by conduct of his blade.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wondrous great prowesse and heroick worth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He shewd that day, and rare ensample made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When two so mighty warriours he dismade.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Attonce he wards and strikes; he takes and paies;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now forst to yield, now forcing to invade;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before, behind, and round about him laies;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So double was his paines, so double be his praise.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Straunge sort of fight, three valiaunt knights to see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Three combates joine in one, and to darraine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A triple warre with triple enmitee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All for their Ladies froward love to gaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which gotten was but hate. So love does raine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In stoutest minds, and maketh monstrous warre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He maketh warre, he maketh peace againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And yett his peace is but continual jarre:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O miserable men, that to him subject arre!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whilst thus they mingled were in furious armes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The faire Medina, with her tresses torne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And naked brest, in pitty of their harmes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Emongst them ran; and, falling them beforne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Besought them by the womb which them had born,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by the loves which were to them most deare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by the knighthood which they sure had sworn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their deadly cruell discord to forbeare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to her just conditions of faire peace to heare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But her two other sisters, standing by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her lowd gainsaid, and both their champions bad</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pursew the end of their strong enmity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As ever of their loves they would be glad.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet she with pitthy words, and counsell sad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still strove their stubborne rages to revoke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That at the last, suppressing fury mad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They gan abstaine from dint of direfull stroke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hearken to the sober speaches which she spoke.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Ah, puissaunt Lords! what cursed evil Spright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or fell Erinnys, in your noble harts</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her hellish brond hath kindled with despight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And stird you up to worke your wilfull smarts?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is this the joy of armes? be these the parts</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of glorious knighthood, after blood to thrust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And not regard dew right and just desarts?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vaine is the vaunt, and victory unjust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That more to mighty hands then rightfull cause doth trust.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“And were there rightfull cause of difference,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet were not better fayre it to accord</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then with bloodguiltinesse to heape offence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And mortal vengeaunce joyne to crime abhord?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O! fly from wrath; fly, O my liefest Lord!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sad be the sights, and bitter fruites of warre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thousand furies wait on wrathfull sword;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ought the praise of prowesse more doth marre</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then fowle revenging rage, and base contentious jarre.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But lovely concord, and most sacred peace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth nourish vertue, and fast friendship breeds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Weake she makes strong, and strong thing does increace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till it the pitch of highest praise exceeds:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Brave be her warres, and honorable deeds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By which she triumphes over yre and pride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And winnes an Olive girlond for her meeds.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be, therefore, O my deare Lords! pacifide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this misseeming discord meekely lay aside.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Her gracious words their rancour did appall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And suncke so deepe into their boyling brests,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That downe they lett their cruell weapons fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And lowly did abase their lofty crests</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To her faire presence and discrete behests.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then she began a treaty to procure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And stablish terms betwixt both their requests,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That as a law for ever should endure;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which to observe in word of knights they did assure.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which to confirme, and fast to bind their league,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After their weary sweat and bloody toile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She them besought, during their quiet treague,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into her lodging to repaire awhile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To rest themselves, and grace to reconcile.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They soone consent: so forth with her they fare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where they are well receivd, and made to spoile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Themselves of soiled armes, and to prepare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their minds to pleasure, and their mouths to dainty fare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And those two froward sisters, their faire loves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came with them eke, all were they wondrous loth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fained cheare, as for the time behoves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But could not colour yet so well the troth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that their natures bad appeard in both;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For both did at their second sister grutch</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And inly grieve, as doth an hidden moth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The inner garment frett, not th’utter touch:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One thought her cheare too litle, th’other thought too mutch.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Elissa (so the eldest hight) did deeme</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such entertainment base, ne ought would eat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ought would speake, but evermore did seeme</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As discontent for want of merth or meat:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No solace could her Paramour intreat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her once to show, ne court, nor dalliaunce;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But with bent lowring browes, as she would threat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She scould, and frownd with froward countenaunce;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unworthy of faire Ladies comely governaunce.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But young Perissa was of other mynd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full of disport, still laughing, loosely light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And quite contrary to her sisters kynd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No measure in her mood, no rule of right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But poured out in pleasure and delight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In wine and meats she flowd above the banck,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in excesse exceeded her owne might;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In sumptuous tire she joyd her selfe to pranck,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But of her love too lavish: (litle have she thanck!)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Fast by her side did sitt the bold <span xml:lang="fr">Sansloy</span>,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fitt mate for such a mincing mineon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who in her loosenesse tooke exceeding joy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Might not be found a francker franion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of her leawd parts to make companion:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Huddibras, more like a Malecontent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did see and grieve at his bold fashion;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hardly could he endure his hardiment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yett still he satt, and inly did him selfe torment.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Betwixt them both the faire Medina sate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With sober grace and goodly carriage:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With equall measure she did moderate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The strong extremities of their outrage.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That forward paire she ever would asswage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When they would strive dew reason to exceed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that same froward twaine would accorage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of her plenty adde unto their need:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So kept she them in order, and her selfe in heed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus fairely shee attempered her feast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And pleas’d them all with meete satiety.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At last, when lust of meat and drinke was ceast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She Guyon deare besought of curtesie</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To tell from whence he came through jeopardy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And whither now on new adventure bownd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who with bold grace, and comely gravity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drawing to him the eies of all arownd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From lofty siege began these words aloud to sownd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“This thy demaund, O Lady! doth revive</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fresh memory in me of that great Queene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Great and most glorious virgin Queene alive,</span>

					<span class="i1">That with her soveraine power, and scepter shene,</span>

				<p>
					<span>In her the richesse of all heavenly grace</span>

					<span class="i1">That men, beholding so great excellence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And rare perfection in mortalitye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doe her adore with sacred reverence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As th’Idole of her makers great magnificence.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“To her I homage and my service owe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In number of the noblest knightes on ground;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mongst whom on me she deigned to bestowe</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That may this day in all the world be found.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An yearely solemne feast she wontes to hold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The day that first doth lead the yeare around,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which all knights of worth and courage bold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Resort, to heare of straunge adventures to be told.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“There this old Palmer shewd himselfe that day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to that mighty Princesse did complaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of grievous mischiefes which a wicked Fay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had wrought, and many whelmd in deadly paine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereof he crav’d redresse. My Soveraine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose glory is in gracious deeds, and joyes</span>

					<span class="i1">Throughout the world her mercy to maintaine,</span>

					<span class="i1">Eftsoones devisd redresse for such annoyes:</span>

					<span>Me, all unfitt for so great purpose, she employes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Now hath faire Phebe with her silver face</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thrise seene the shadowes of the neather world,</span>

					<span class="i1">Till I that false Acrasia have wonne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of whose fowle deedes, too hideous to bee told,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I witnesse am, and this their wretched sonne,</span>

					<span>Whose wofull parents she hath wickedly fordonne.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Tell on, fayre Sir,” said she, “that dolefull tale,</span>

					<span class="i1">From which sad ruth does seeme you to restraine,</span>

					<span>And many-folded shield he bound about his wrest.</span>

					<span class="i1">He lately heard that dying Lady grone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He left his steed without, and speare besyde,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Purloynd both steed and speare, and ran away full light.</span>

					<span>Thereat the Scarcrow wexed wondrous prowd,</span>

					<span class="i1">In his owne kind he gan him selfe unfold;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For he was wylie witted, and growne old</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In cunning sleightes and practick knavery.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From that day forth he cast for to uphold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His ydle humour with fine flattery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And blow the bellowes to his swelling vanity.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Trompart, fitt man for Braggadochio,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To serve at court in view of vaunting eye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vaine-glorious man, when fluttring wind does blow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In his light winges, is lifted up to skye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The scorne of knighthood and trew chevalrye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To thinke, without desert of gentle deed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And noble worth, to be advaunced hye:</span>

					<span class="i1">Such prayse is shame; but honour, vertues meed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Doth beare the fayrest flowre in honourable seed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So forth they pas, a well consorted payre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till that at length with Archimage they meet:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who seeing one, that shone in armour fayre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On goodly courser thondring with his feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eftsoones supposed him a person meet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his revenge to make the instrument;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For since the Redcrosse knight he erst did weet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To been with Guyon knitt in one consent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ill, which earst to him, he now to Guyon ment.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And coming close to Trompart gan inquere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of him, what mightie warriour that mote bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That rode in golden sell with single spere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But wanted sword to wreake his enmitee?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“He is a great adventurer,” (said he)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“That hath his sword through hard assay forgone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now hath vowd, till he avenged bee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that despight, never to wearen none:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That speare is him enough to doen a thousand grone.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Th’enchaunter greatly joyed in the vaunt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And weened well ere long his will to win,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And both his foen with equall foyle to daunt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tho to him louting lowly did begin</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To plaine of wronges, which had committed bin</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By Guyon, and by that false Redcrosse knight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which two, through treason and deceiptfull gin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had slayne Sir Mordant and his Lady bright:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That mote him honour win to wreak so foule despight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Therewith all suddeinly he seemd enraged,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And threatned death with dreadfull countenaunce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if their lives had in his hand beene gaged;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with stiffe force shaking his mortall launce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To let him weet his doughtie valiaunce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus said: “Old man, great sure shal be thy meed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If, where those knights for feare of dew vengeaunce</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doe lurke, thou certainly to mee areed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I may wreake on them their hainous hatefull deed.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Certes, my Lord,” (said he) “that shall I soone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And give you eke good helpe to their decay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But mote I wisely you advise to doon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Give no ods to your foes, but doe purvay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Your selfe of sword before that bloody day;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For they be two the prowest knights on grownd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And oft approv’d in many hard assay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke of surest steele that may be fownd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do arme your self against that day, them to confownd.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Dotard,” (said he) “let be thy deepe advise:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seemes that through many yeares thy wits thee faile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that weake eld hath left thee nothing wise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Els never should thy judgement be so frayle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To measure manhood by the sword or mayle.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is not enough fowre quarters of a man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Withouten sword or shield, an hoste to quayle?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou litle wotest what this right-hand can:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Speake they which have beheld the battailes which it wan.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The man was much abashed at his boast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet well he wist that whoso would contend</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With either of those knightes on even coast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should neede of all his armes him to defend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet feared least his boldnesse should offend.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When Braggadocchio saide; “Once I did sweare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When with one sword seven knightes I brought to end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thenceforth in battaile never sword to beare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But it were that which noblest knight on earth doth weare.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Perdy, Sir knight,” saide then th’enchaunter blive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“That shall I shortly purchase to your hond;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For now the best and noblest knight alive</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Prince Arthur is, that wonnes in Faerie lond:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He hath a sword that flames like burning brond.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The same by my device I undertake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall by to morrow by thy side be fond.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At which bold word that boaster gan to quake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wondred in his minde what mote that Monster make.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He stay’d not for more bidding, but away</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was suddein vanished out of his sight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Northerne winde his wings did broad display</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At his commaund, and reared him up light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From off the earth to take his aerie flight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They look’t about, but nowhere could espye</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tract of his foot: then dead through great affright</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They both nigh were, and each bad other flye:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both fled attonce, ne ever backe retourned eye;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Till that they come unto a forrest greene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which they shrowd themselves from causeles feare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet feare them followes still where so they beene:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Each trembling leafe and whistling wind they heare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As ghastly bug, does greatly them affeare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet both doe strive their fearefulnesse to faine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At last they heard a horne that shrilled cleare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Throughout the wood that ecchoed againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And made the forrest ring, as it would rive in twaine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Eft through the thicke they heard one rudely rush,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With noyse whereof he from his loftie steed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Downe fell to ground, and crept into a bush,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To hide his coward head from dying dreed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Trompart stoutly stayd to taken heed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of what might hap. Eftsoone there stepped foorth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A goodly Ladie clad in hunters weed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That seemd to be a woman of great worth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by her stately portance borne of heavenly birth.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Her face so faire as flesh it seemed not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But hevenly pourtraict of bright Angels hew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cleare as the skye, withouten blame or blot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through goodly mixture of complexions dew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in her cheekes the vermeill red did shew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like roses in a bed of lillies shed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which ambrosiall odours from them threw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gazers sence with double pleasure fed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hable to heale the sicke, and to revive the ded.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In her faire eyes two living lamps did flame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Kindled above at th’hevenly makers light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And darted fyrie beames out of the same,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So passing persant, and so wondrous bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That quite bereav’d the rash beholders sight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In them the blinded god his lustfull fyre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To kindle oft assayd, but had no might;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For, with dredd Majestie and awfull yre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She broke his wanton darts, and quenched bace desyre.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Her yvorie forhead, full of bountie brave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like a broad table did it selfe dispred;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For Love his loftie triumphes to engrave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And write the battailes of his great godhed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All good and honour might therein be red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For there their dwelling was. And, when she spake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sweete wordes like dropping honny she did shed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And twixt the perles and rubins softly brake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A silver sound, that heavenly musicke seemd to make.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Upon her eyelids many Graces sate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under the shadow of her even browes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Working belgardes and amorous retrate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And everie one her with a grace endowes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And everie one with meekenesse to her bowes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So glorious mirrhour of celestiall grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And soveraine moniment of mortall vowes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How shall frayle pen descrive her heavenly face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For feare, through want of skill, her beauty to disgrace?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So faire, and thousand thousand times more faire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She seemd, when she presented was to sight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And was yclad, for heat of scorching aire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All in a silken Camus lilly whight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Purfled upon with many a folded plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which all above besprinckled was throughout</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With golden aygulets, that glistred bright</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like twinckling starres; and all the skirt about</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was hemd with golden fringe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Below her ham her weed did somewhat trayne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And her streight legs most bravely were embayld</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In gilden buskins of costly Cordwayne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All bard with golden bendes, which were entayld</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With curious antickes, and full fayre aumayld:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before, they fastned were under her knee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In a rich jewel, and therein entrayld</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ends of all the knots, that none might see</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How they within their fouldings close enwrapped bee:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like two faire marble pillours they were seene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which doe the temple of the Gods support,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom all the people decke with girlands greene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And honour in their festivall resort;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those same with stately grace and princely port</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She taught to tread, when she herselfe would grace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But with the woody Nymphes when she did play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or when the flying Libbard she did chace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She could them nimbly move, and after fly apace.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And in her hand a sharpe bore-speare she held,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And at her backe a bow and quiver gay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stuft with steeleheaded dartes, wherewith she queld</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The salvage beastes in her victorious play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Knit with a golden bauldricke, which forelay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Athwart her snowy brest, and did divide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her daintie paps; which, like young fruit in May,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now little gan to swell, and being tide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through her thin weed their places only signifide.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Her yellow lockes, crisped like golden wyre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">About her shoulders weren loosely shed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, when the winde emongst them did inspyre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They waved like a penon wyde dispred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And low behinde her backe were scattered:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, whether art it were or heedlesse hap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As through the flouring forrest rash she fled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In her rude heares sweet flowres themselves did lap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And flourishing fresh leaves and blossoms did enwrap.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Such as Diana by the sandy shore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of swift Eurotas, or on Cynthus greene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where all the Nymphes have her unwares forlore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wandreth alone with bow and arrowes keene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To seeke her game: Or as that famous Queene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Amazons, whom Pyrrhus did destroy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The day that first of Priame she was seene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did shew her selfe in great triumphant joy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To succour the weake state of sad afflicted Troy.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Such when as hartlesse Trompart her did vew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He was dismayed in his coward minde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And doubted whether he himselfe should shew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or fly away, or bide alone behinde;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both feare and hope he in her face did finde:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When she at last him spying thus bespake:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Hayle, Groome! didst not thou see a bleeding Hynde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose right haunch earst my stedfast arrow strake?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If thou didst, tell me, that I may her overtake.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Wherewith reviv’d, this answere forth he threw:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“O Goddesse, (for such I thee take to bee)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For nether doth thy face terrestriall shew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor voyce sound mortall; I avow to thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such wounded beast as that I did not see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sith earst into this forrest wild I came.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But mote thy goodlyhed forgive it mee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To weete which of the gods I shall thee name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That unto thee dew worship I may rightly frame.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To whom she thus⁠—but ere her words ensewd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the bush her eye did suddein glaunce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which vaine Braggadocchio was mewd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And saw it stirre: she lefte her percing launce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And towards gan a deadly shafte advaunce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In mind to marke the beast. At which sad stowre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Trompart forth stept to stay the mortall chaunce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out crying; “O! what ever hevenly powre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or earthly wight thou be, withhold this deadly howre.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“O! stay thy hand; for yonder is no game</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For thy fiers arrowes, them to exercize;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But loe! my Lord, my liege, whose warlike name</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is far renowmd through many bold emprize;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now in shade he shrowded yonder lies.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She staid: with that he crauld out of his nest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forth creeping on his caitive hands and thies;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, standing stoutly up, his lofty crest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did fiercely shake, and rowze as comming late from rest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As fearfull fowle, that long in secret cave</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For dread of soring hauke her selfe hath hid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor caring how, her silly life to save,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She her gay painted plumes disorderid;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeing at last her selfe from daunger rid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Peepes forth, and soone renews her native pride:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She gins her feathers fowle disfigured</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Prowdly to prune, and sett on every side;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She shakes off shame, ne thinks how erst she did her hide.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So when her goodly visage he beheld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He gan himselfe to vaunt: but, when he vewd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those deadly tooles which in her hand she held,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Soone into other fitts he was transmewd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till she to him her gracious speach renewd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“All haile, Sir knight! and well may thee befall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As all the like, which honor have pursewd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through deeds of armes and prowesse martiall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All vertue merits praise, but such the most of all.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To whom he thus: “O fairest under skie!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Trew be thy words, and worthie of thy praise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That warlike feats doest highest glorifie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therein I have spent all my youthly daies,</span>

					<span class="i1">Endevoring my dreaded name to raise</span>

					<span>In her eternall tromp, with laurell girlond cround.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But what art thou, O Lady! which doest raunge</span>

					<span>In brave poursuitt of honorable deed,</span>

					<span class="i1">Which unto things of valorous pretence</span>

					<span class="i1">Seemes to be borne by native influence;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As feates of armes, and love to entertaine:</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Proper to gentle blood: some others faine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To menage steeds, as did this vaunter, but in vaine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But he, the rightfull owner of that steede,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who well could menage and subdew his pride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whiles on foot was forced for to yeed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With that blacke Palmer, his most trusty guide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who suffred not his wandring feete to slide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when strong passion, or weake fleshlinesse,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It fortuned, forth faring on his way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He saw from far, or seemed for to see,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereto he drew in hast it to agree.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A mad man, or that feigned mad to bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drew by the heare along upon the grownd</span>

					<span class="i1">Whom sore he bett, and gor’d with many a wownd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That cheekes with teares, and sydes with blood, did all abownd.</span>

					<span>And him behynd a wicked Hag did stalke,</span>

					<span class="i1">In ragged robes and filthy disaray;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her other leg was lame, that she no’te walke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But on a staffe her feeble steps did stay:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her lockes, that loathly were and hoarie gray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Grew all afore, and loosely hong unrold;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bat all behinde was bald, and worne away,</span>

					<span class="i1">That none thereof could ever taken hold;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke her face ill-favourd, full of wrinckles old.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And ever as she went her toung did walke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In fowle reproch, and termes of vile despight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Provoking him, by her outrageous talke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To heape more vengeance on that wretched wight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sometimes she raught him stones, wherwith to smite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sometimes her staffe, though it her one leg were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Withouten which she could not goe upright;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne any evill meanes she did forbeare,</span>

				<p>
					<span>The noble Guyon, mov’d with great remorse,</span>

					<span class="i1">And after, adding more impetuous forse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His mighty hands did on the madman lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And pluckt him backe; who, all on fire streight way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against him turning all his fell intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With beastly brutish rage gan him assay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And smott, and bitt, and kickt, and scratcht, and rent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And did he wist not what in his avengement.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And sure he was a man of mickle might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had he had governaunce it well to guyde;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, when the frantick fitt inflamd his spright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His force was vaine, and strooke more often wyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then at the aymed marke which he had eyde:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And oft himselfe he chaunst to hurt unwares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whylest reason, blent through passion, nought descryde;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, as a blindfold Bull, at randon fares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And where he hits nought knowes, and whom he hurts nought cares.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His rude assault and rugged handeling</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Straunge seemed to the knight, that aye with foe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In fayre defence and goodly menaging</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of armes was wont to fight; yet nathemoe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was he abashed now, not fighting so;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But more enfierced through his currish play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him sternly grypt, and hailing to and fro,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To overthrow him strongly did assay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But overthrew himselfe unwares, and lower lay:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And being downe the villein sore did beate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And bruze with clownish fistes his manly face;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke the Hag, with many a bitter threat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still cal’d upon to kill him in the place.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With whose reproch, and odious menace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The knight emboyling in his haughtie hart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Knitt all his forces, and gan soone unbrace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His grasping hold: so lightly did upstart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And drew his deadly weapon to maintaine his part.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when the Palmer saw, he loudly cryde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Not so, O Guyon! never thinke that so</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Monster can be maistred or destroyd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He is not, ah! he is not such a foe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As steele can wound, or strength can overthroe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That same is Furor, cursed cruel wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That unto knighthood workes much shame and woe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that same Hag, his aged mother, hight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Occasion; the roote of all wrath and despight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“With her, whoso will raging Furor tame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Must first begin, and well her amenage:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">First her restraine from her reprochfull blame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And evill meanes, with which she doth enrage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her frantick sonne, and kindles his corage;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then, when she is withdrawne or strong withstood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It’s eath his ydle fury to aswage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And calme the tempest of his passion wood:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bankes are overflowne when stopped is the flood.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Therewith Sir Guyon left his first emprise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, turning to that woman, fast her hent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By the hoare lockes that hong before her eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to the ground her threw: yet n’ould she stent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her bitter rayling and foule revilement,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But still provokt her sonne to wreake her wrong;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But nathelesse he did her still torment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, catching hold of her ungratious tonge</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereon an yron lock did fasten firme and strong.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then, whenas use of speach was from her reft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With her two crooked handes she signes did make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And beckned him, the last help she had left;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he that last left helpe away did take,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And both her handes fast bound unto a stake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That she note stirre. Then gan her sonne to flye</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full fast away, and did her quite forsake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Guyon after him in hast did hye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And soone him overtooke in sad perplexitye.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In his strong armes he stifly him embraste,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who him gainstriving nought at all prevaild;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For all his power was utterly defaste,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And furious fitts at earst quite weren quaild:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Oft he re’nforst, and oft his forces fayld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet yield he would not, nor his rancor slack.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then him to ground he cast, and rudely hayld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And both his hands fast bound behind his backe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And both his feet in fetters to an yron racke.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With hundred yron chaines he did him bind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hundred knots, that did him sore constraine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet his great yron teeth he still did grind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And grimly gnash, threatning revenge in vaine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His burning eyen, whom bloody strakes did staine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stared full wide, and threw forth sparkes of fyre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more for ranck despight then for great paine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shakt his long locks colourd like copper-wyre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bitt his tawny beard to shew his raging yre.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus when as Guyon Furor had captivd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turning about he saw that wretched Squyre,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Being at last recured, he gan inquyre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What hard mishap him brought to such distresse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And made that caytives thrall, the thrall of wretchednesse.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With hart then throbbing, and with watry eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Fayre Sir” (quoth he) “what man can shun the hap,</span>

					<span class="i1">Of deadly drugs I gave him drink anon,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Thus heaping crime on crime, and griefe on griefe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To losse of love adjoyning losse of frend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I meant to purge both with a third mischiefe,</span>

					<span class="i1">That was Pryene; she did first offend,</span>

					<span>And I, poursewing my fell purpose, after went.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Feare gave her winges, and rage enforst my flight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through woods and plaines so long I did her chace,</span>

					<span class="i1">Till this mad man, whom your victorious might</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hath now fast bound, me met in middle space.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As I her, so he me poursewd apace,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sore chauffed at my stay in such a cace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with my heat kindled his cruell fyre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which kindled once, his mother did more rage inspyre.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Betwixt them both they have me doen to dye,</span>

					<span class="i1">That death were better then such agony</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As griefe and fury unto me did bring;</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When he thus ended had his sorrowing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said Guyon; “Squyre, sore have ye beene diseasd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But all your hurts may soone through temperance be easd.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then gan the Palmer thus; “Most wretched man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That to affections does the bridle lend!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In their beginning they are weake and wan,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whiles they are weake, betimes with them contend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For, when they once to perfect strength do grow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Strong warres they make, and cruell battry bend</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gainst fort of Reason, it to overthrow:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wrath, gelosy, griefe, love, this Squyre have laide thus low.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Wrath, gealosie, griefe, love, do thus expell:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wrath is a fire; and gealosie a weede;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Griefe is a flood; and love a monster fell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The fire of sparkes, the weede of little seede,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The flood of drops, the Monster filth did breede:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But sparks, seed, drops, and filth, do thus delay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sparks soone quench, the springing seed outweed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The drops dry up, and filth wipe cleane away:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So shall wrath, gealosy, griefe, love, die and decay.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Unlucky Squire,” (saide Guyon) “sith thou hast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Falne into mischiefe through intemperaunce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Henceforth take heede of that thou now hast past,</span>

					<span class="i1">And guyde thy waies with warie governaunce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Least worse betide thee by some later chaunce.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But read how art thou nam’d, and of what kin?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Phaon I hight,” (quoth he) “and do advaunce</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mine auncestry from famous Coradin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who first to rayse our house to honour did begin.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus as he spake, lo! far away they spyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A varlet ronning towardes hastily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose flying feet so fast their way applyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That round about a cloud of dust did fly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which, mingled all with sweate, did dim his eye.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He soone approched, panting, breathlesse, whot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all so soyld that none could him descry:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His countenaunce was bold, and bashed not</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Guyons lookes, but scornefull eyeglaunce at him shot.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Behind his backe he bore a brasen shield,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On which was drawen faire, in colours fit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A flaming fire in midst of bloody field,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And round about the wreath this word was writ,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1"><em>Burnt I doe burne</em>. Right well beseemed it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be the shield of some redoubted knight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in his hand two dartes, exceeding flit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And deadly sharp, he held, whose heads were dight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In poyson and in blood of malice and despight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When he in presence came, to Guyon first</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He boldly spake; “Sir knight, if knight thou bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Abandon this forestalled place at erst,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For feare of further harme, I counsell thee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or bide the chaunce at thine own jeopardee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The knight at his great boldnesse wondered;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, though he scornd his ydle vanitee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet mildly him to purpose answered;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For not to grow of nought he it conjectured.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Varlet, this place most dew to me I deeme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yielded by him that held it forcibly:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But whence should come that harme, which thou dost seeme</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To threat to him that mindes his chaunce t’abye?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Perdy,” (sayd he) “here comes, and is hard by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A knight of wondrous powre and great assay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That never yet encountred enemy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But did him deadly daunt, or fowle dismay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne thou for better hope, if thou his presence stay.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“How hight he then,” (sayd Guyon) “and from whence?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Pyrochles is his name, renowmed farre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For his bold feates and hardy confidence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full oft approvd in many a cruell warre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The brother of Cymochles, both which arre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sonnes of old Acrates and Despight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Acrates, sonne of Phlegeton and Jarre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Phlegeton is sonne of Herebus and Night;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Herebus sonne of Aeternitie is hight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“So from immortall race he does proceede,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That mortall hands may not withstand his might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drad for his derring doe and bloody deed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For all in blood and spoile is his delight.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And stirre him up to strife and cruell fight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fly therefore, fly this fearefull stead anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Least thy foolhardize worke thy sad confusion.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“His be that care, whom most it doth concerne,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(Sayd he) “but whither with such hasty flight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Art thou now bownd? for well mote I discerne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Great cause, that carries thee so swifte and light.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“My Lord,” (quoth he) “me sent, and streight behight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To seeke Occasion, where so she bee:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For he is all disposd to bloody fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And breathes out wrath and hainous crueltee:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hard is his hap that first fals in his jeopardee.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Mad man,” (said then the Palmer) “that does seeke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Occasion to wrath, and cause of strife:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shee comes unsought, and shonned followes eke.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Happy! who can abstaine, when Rancor rife</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Kindles Revenge, and threats his rusty knife.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Woe never wants where every cause is caught;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And rash Occasion makes unquiet life!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Then loe! wher bound she sits, whom thou hast sought,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said Guyon: “let that message to thy Lord be brought.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>That when the varlett heard and saw, streight way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He wexed wondrous wroth, and said; “Vile knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That knights and knighthood doest with shame upbray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And shewst th’ensample of thy childishe might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With silly weake old woman that did fight!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Great glory and gay spoile, sure hast thou gott,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And stoutly prov’d thy puissance here in sight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That shall Pyrochles well requite, I wott,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with thy blood abolish so reprochfull blott.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that one of his thrillant darts he threw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Headed with yre, and vengeable despight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The quivering steele his aymed end wel knew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to his brest it selfe intended right.</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>After that varlets flight, it was not long</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere on the plaine fast pricking Guyon spide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One in bright armes embatteiled full strong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, as the Sunny beames do glaunce and glide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the trembling wave, so shined bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And round about him threw forth sparkling fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That seemd him to enflame on every side:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His steed was bloody red, and fomed yre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When with the maistring spur he did him roughly stire.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Approching nigh, he never staid to greete,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne chaffar words, prowd corage to provoke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But prickt so fiers, that underneath his feete</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The smouldring dust did rownd about him smoke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both horse and man nigh able for to choke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fayrly couching his steeleheaded speare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him first saluted with a sturdy stroke:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It booted nought Sir Guyon, comming neare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To thincke such hideous puissaunce on foot to beare;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But lightly shunned it; and, passing by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With his bright blade did smite at him so fell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the sharpe steele, arriving forcibly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On his broad shield, bitt not, but glauncing fell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On his horse necke before the quilted sell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from the head the body sundred quight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So him dismounted low he did compell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On foot with him to matchen equall fight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The truncked beast fast bleeding did him fowly dight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sore bruzed with the fall he slow uprose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all enraged thus him loudly shent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Disleall Knight, whose coward corage chose</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To wreake it selfe on beast all innocent,</span>

					<span class="i1">And shund the marke at which it should be ment;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therby thine armes seem strong, but manhood frayl:</span>

					<br/>
					<span>If wonted force and fortune doe me not much fayl.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that he drew his flaming sword, and strooke</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his sevenfolded shield away it tooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, glauncing on his helmet, made a large</span>

				<p>
					<span>Exceeding wroth was Guyon at that blow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And much asham’d that stroke of living arme</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should him dismay, and make him stoup so low,</span>

					<span class="i1">Though otherwise it did him litle harme:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tho, hurling high his yron braced arme,</span>

					<span class="i1">He smote so manly on his shoulder plate,</span>

					<span class="i1">That all his left side it did quite disarme;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet there the steel stayd not, but inly bate</span>

					<span>Deepe in his flesh, and opened wide a red floodgate.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Deadly dismayd with horror of that dint</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pyrochles was, and grieved eke entyre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet nathemore did it his fury stint,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But added flame unto his former fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That wel nigh molt his hart in raging yre:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne thenceforth his approved skill, to ward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or strike, or hurtle rownd in warlike gyre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Remembred he, ne car’d for his saufgard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But rudely rag’d, and like a cruell tygre far’d.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He hewd, and lasht, and foynd, and thondred blowes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And every way did seeke into his life;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne plate, ne male, could ward so mighty throwes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But yeilded passage to his cruell knife.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Guyon, in the heat of all his strife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was wary wise, and closely did awayt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Avauntage, whilest his foe did rage most rife:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sometimes athwart, sometimes he strook him strayt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And falsed oft his blowes t’illude him with such bayt.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like as a Lyon, whose imperiall powre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A prowd rebellious Unicorn defyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">T’avoide the rash assault and wrathful stowre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his fiers foe, him to a tree applyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And when him ronning in full course he spyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He slips aside; the whiles that furious beast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His precious home, sought of his enimyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Strikes in the stocke, ne thence can be releast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to the mighty victor yields a bounteous feast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With such faire sleight him Guyon often fayld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till at the last all breathlesse, weary, faint,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him spying, with fresh onsett he assayld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And kindling new his corage seeming queint,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Strooke him so hugely, that through great constraint</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He made him stoup perforce unto his knee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And doe unwilling worship to the Saint,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That on his shield depainted he did see:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such homage till that instant never learned hee.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whom Guyon seeing stoup, poursewed fast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The present offer of faire victory,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And soone his dreadfull blade about he cast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherewith he smote his haughty crest so hye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That streight on grownd made him full low to lye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then on his brest his victor foote he thrust:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With that he cryde; “Mercy! doe me not dye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne deeme thy force by fortunes doome unjust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That hath (maugre her spight) thus low me laid in dust.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Eftsoones his cruel hand Sir Guyon stayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tempring the passion with advizement slow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And maistring might on enimy dismayd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For th’equall die of warre he well did know:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then to him said; “Live, and alleagaunce owe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To him that gives thee life and liberty;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And henceforth by this daies ensample trow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That hasty wroth, and heedlesse hazardry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Doe breede repentaunce late, and lasting infamy.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So up he let him rise; who, with grim looke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And count’naunce sterne, upstanding, gan to grind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His grated teeth for great disdeigne, and shooke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His sandy lockes, long hanging downe behind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Knotted in blood and dust, for grief of mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he in ods of armes was conquered:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet in himselfe some comfort he did find,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That him so noble knight had maystered;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose bounty more then might, yet both, he wondered.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which Guyon marking said; “Be nought agriev’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sir knight, that thus ye now subdewed arre:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was never man, who most conquestes atchiev’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But sometimes had the worse, and lost by warre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet shortly gaynd that losse exceeded farre.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Losse is no shame, nor to bee lesse then foe;</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Fly, O Pyrochles! fly the dreadfull warre</span>

					<span class="i1">That in thy selfe thy lesser partes do move;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Outrageous anger, and woe-working jarre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Direfull impatience, and hart-murdring love:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those, those thy foes, those warriours far remove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which thee to endlesse bale captived lead.</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>That thee against me drew with so impetuous dread.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Dreadlesse,” (said he) “that shall I soone declare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It was complaind that thou hadst done great tort</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto an aged woman, poore and bare,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ill beseemes thee, such as I thee see,</span>

					<span>And to her captive sonne yield his first libertee.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thereat Sir Guyon smylde; “And is that all,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(Said he) “that thee so sore displeased hath?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Great mercy, sure, for to enlarge a thrall,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereat he, wondrous glad, out of the path</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did lightly leape, where he them bound did see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gan to breake the bands of their captivitee.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Soone as Occasion felt her selfe untyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before her sonne could well assoyled bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She to her use returnd, and streight defyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both Guyon and Pyrochles; th’one (said shee)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bycause he wonne; the other, because hee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was wonne. So matter did she make of nought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To stirre up strife, and garre them disagree:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, soone as Furor was enlargd, she sought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To kindle his quencht fyre, and thousand causes wrought.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It was not long ere she inflam’d him so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he would algates with Pyrochles fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And his redeemer chalengd for his foe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because he had not well mainteind his right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But yielded had to that same straunger knight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now gan Pyrochles wex as wood as hee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And him affronted with impatient might:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So both together fiers engrasped bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whyles Guyon standing by their uncouth strife does see.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Him all that while Occasion did provoke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against Pyrochles, and new matter fram’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the old, him stirring to bee wroke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his late wronges, in which she oft him blam’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For suffering such abuse as knighthood sham’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And him dishabled quyte. But he was wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne would with vaine occasions be inflam’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet others she more urgent did devise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet nothing could him to impatience entise.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Their fell contention still increased more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more thereby increased Furors might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he his foe has hurt and wounded sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And him in blood and durt deformed quight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His mother eke, more to augment his spight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now brought to him a flaming fyer brond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which she in Stygian lake, ay burning bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had kindled: that she gave into his hond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That armd with fire more hardly he mote him withstond.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tho gan that villein wex so fiers and strong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That nothing might sustaine his furious forse:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He cast him downe to ground, and all along</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drew him through durt and myre without remorse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fowly battered his comely corse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Guyon much disdeigned so loathly sight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At last he was compeld to cry perforse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Help, O Sir Guyon! helpe, most noble knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To ridd a wretched man from handes of hellish wight!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The knight was greatly moved at his playnt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gan him dight to succour his distresse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till that the Palmer, by his grave restraynt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him stayd from yielding pitifull redresse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said; “Deare sonne, thy causelesse ruth represse,</span>

					<span class="i1">He that his sorrow sought through wilfulnesse,</span>

					<span>Deserves to taste his follies fruit, repented payne.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Guyon obayd: So him away he drew</span>

					<span class="i1">From needlesse trouble of renewing fight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Already fought, his voyage to poursew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But rash Pyrochles varlett, Atin hight,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him deeming dead, as then he seemd in sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fledd fast away to tell his funerall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto his brother, whom Cymochles men did call.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He was a man of rare redoubted might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Famous throughout the world for warlike prayse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And glorious spoiles, purchast in perilous fight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full many doughtie knightes he in his dayes</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose carkases, for terrour of his name,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hong their conquerd armes, for more defame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On gallow trees, in honour of his dearest Dame.</span>

					<span class="i1">Can call out of the bodies of fraile wightes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom then she does transforme to monstrous hewes,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A gentle streame, whose murmuring wave did play</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Emongst the puny stones, and made a sowne,</span>

					<span class="i1">To steale a snatch of amorous conceipt,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Made dronke with drugs of deare voluptuous receipt.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Atin, arriving there, when him he spyde</span>

					<span>A harder lesson to learne Continence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In joyous pleasure then in grievous paine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For sweetnesse doth allure the weaker sence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So strongly, that uneathes it can refraine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From that which feeble nature covets faine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But griefe and wrath, that be her enemies</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And foes of life, she better can abstaine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet vertue vauntes in both her victories,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Guyon in them all shewes goodly maysteries.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whom bold Cymochles traveiling to finde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With cruell purpose bent to wreake on him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The wrath which Atin kindled in his mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came to a river, by whose utmost brim</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wayting to passe, he saw whereas did swim</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along the shore, as swift as glaunce of eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A litle Gondelay, bedecked trim</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With boughes and arbours woven cunningly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That like a litle forrest seemed outwardly.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And therein sate a Lady fresh and fayre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Making sweet solace to herselfe alone:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sometimes she song as lowd as larke in ayre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sometimes she laught, as merry as Pope Jone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet was there not with her else any one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That to her might move cause of meriment:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Matter of merth enough, though there were none,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She could devise; and thousand waies invent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To feede her foolish humour and vaine jolliment.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when far off Cymochles heard and saw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He lowdly cald to such as were abord</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The little barke unto the shore to draw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And him to ferry over that deepe ford.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The merry mariner unto his word</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Soone hearkned, and her painted bote streightway</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turnd to the shore, where that same warlike Lord</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She in receiv’d; but Atin by no way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She would admit, albe the knight her much did pray.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Eftsoones her shallow ship away did slide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More swift then swallow sheres the liquid skye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Withouten oare or Pilot it to guide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or winged canvas with the wind to fly:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Onely she turnd a pin, and by and by</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It cut away upon the yielding wave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne cared she her course for to apply;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For it was taught the way which she would have,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And both from rocks and flats it selfe could wisely save.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And all the way the wanton Damsell found</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">New merth her passenger to entertaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For she in pleasaunt purpose did abound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And greatly joyed merry tales to faine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which a store-house did with her remaine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet seemed, nothing well they her became;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For all her wordes she drownd with laughter vaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wanted grace in utt’ring of the same,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That turned all her pleasaunce to a scoffing game.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And other whiles vaine toyes she would devize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As her fantasticke wit did most delight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sometimes her head she fondly would aguize</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With gaudy girlonds, or fresh flowrets dight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">About her necke, or rings of rushes plight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sometimes, to do him laugh, she would assay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To laugh at shaking of the leaves light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or to behold the water worke and play</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About her little frigot, therein making way.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Her light behaviour and loose dalliaunce</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gave wondrous great contentment to the knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That of his way he had no sovenaunce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor care of vow’d revenge and cruell fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But to weake wench did yield his martiall might:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So easie was to quench his flamed minde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With one sweete drop of sensuall delight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So easie is t’appease the stormy winde</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of malice in the calme of pleasaunt womankind.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Diverse discourses in their way they spent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mongst which Cymochles of her questioned</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both what she was, and what that usage ment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which in her cott she daily practized?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Vaine man,” (saide she) “that wouldest be reckoned</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A straunger in thy home, and ignoraunt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Phædria, (for so my name is red)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Phædria, thine owne fellow servaunt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For thou to serve Acrasia thy selfe doest vaunt.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“In this wide Inland sea, that hight by name</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Idle lake, my wandring ship I row,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That knowes her port, and thither sayles by ayme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne care, ne feare I how the wind do blow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or whether swift I wend, or whether slow:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both slow and swift alike do serve my tourne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne swelling Neptune ne lowd thundring Jove</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Can chaunge my cheare, or make me ever mourne:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My little boat can safely passe this perilous bourne.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whiles thus she talked, and whiles thus she toyd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They were far past the passage which he spake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And come unto an Island waste and voyd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That floted in the midst of that great lake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There her small Gondelay her port did make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that gay payre, issewing on the shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Disburdned her. Their way they forward take</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the land that lay them faire before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose pleasaunce she him shewd, and plentifull great store.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It was a chosen plott of fertile land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Emongst wide waves sett, like a litle nest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if it had by Natures cunning hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bene choycely picked out from all the rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And laid forth for ensample of the best:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No daintie flowre or herbe that growes on grownd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No arborett with painted blossomes drest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And smelling sweete, but there it might be fownd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To bud out faire, and throwe her sweete smels al arownd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>No tree whose braunches did not bravely spring;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No braunch whereon a fine bird did not sitt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No bird but did her shrill notes sweetely sing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No song but did containe a lovely ditt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Trees, braunches, birds, and songs, were framed fitt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For to allure fraile mind to carelesse ease:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Carelesse the man soone woxe, and his weake witt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was overcome of thing that did him please;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So pleased did his wrathfull purpose faire appease.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus when shee had his eyes and sences fed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With false delights, and fild with pleasures vayn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into a shady dale she soft him led,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And layd him downe upon a grassy playn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And her sweete selfe without dread or disdayn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She sett beside, laying his head disarmd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In her loose lap, it softly to sustayn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where soone he slumbred fearing not be harmd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The whiles with a love lay she thus him sweetly charmd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Behold, O man! that toilesome paines doest take,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The flowrs, the fields, and all that pleasaunt growes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How they them selves doe thine ensample make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whiles nothing envious nature them forth throwes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of her fruitfull lap; how no man knowes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They spring, they bud, they blossome fresh and faire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And decke the world with their rich pompous showes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet no man for them taketh paines or care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet no man to them can his carefull paines compare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The lilly, Lady of the flowring field,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The flowre-deluce, her lovely Paramoure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bid thee to them thy fruitlesse labors yield,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And soone leave off this toylsome weary stoure:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Loe, loe! how brave she decks her bounteous boure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With silkin curtens and gold coverletts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therein to shrowd her sumptuous Belamoure;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet nether spinnes nor cards, ne cares nor fretts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to her mother Nature all her care she letts.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Why then doest thou, O man! that of them all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Art Lord, and eke of nature Soveraine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wilfully make thyselfe a wretched thrall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And waste thy joyous howres in needelesse paine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeking for daunger and adventures vaine?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What bootes it al to have, and nothing use?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who shall him rew that swimming in the maine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will die for thrist, and water doth refuse?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Refuse such fruitlesse toile, and present pleasures chuse.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>By this she had him lulled fast asleepe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That of no worldly thing he care did take:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then she with liquors strong his eies did steepe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That nothing should him hastily awake.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So she him lefte, and did her selfe betake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto her boat again, with which she clefte</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The slouthfull wave of that great griesy lake:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Soone shee that Island far behind her lefte,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now is come to that same place where first she wefte.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>By this time was the worthy Guyon brought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the other side of that wide strond</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where she was rowing, and for passage sought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him needed not long call; shee soone to hond</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her ferry brought, where him she byding fond</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With his sad guide: him selfe she tooke aboord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But the Blacke Palmer suffred still to stond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne would for price or prayers once affoord</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To ferry that old man over the perlous foord.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Guyon was loath to leave his guide behind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet being entred might not backe retyre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the flitt barke, obaying to her mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forth launched quickly as she did desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne gave him leave to bid that aged sire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Adieu; but nimbly ran her wonted course</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through the dull billowes thicke as troubled mire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom nether wind out of their seat could forse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor timely tides did drive out of their sluggish sourse.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And by the way, as was her wonted guize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her mery fitt shee freshly gan to reare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And did of joy and jollity devize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her selfe to cherish, and her guest to cheare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The knight was courteous, and did not forbeare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her honest merth and pleasaunce to partake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when he saw her toy, and gibe, and geare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And passe the bonds of modest merimake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her dalliaunce he despis’d, and follies did forsake.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet she still followed her former style,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said and did all that mote him delight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till they arrived in that pleasaunt Ile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where sleeping late she lefte her other knight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But whenas Guyon of that land had sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He wist him selfe amisse, and angry said;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Ah, Dame! perdy ye have not doen me right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus to mislead mee, whiles I you obaid:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Me litle needed from my right way to have straid.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Faire Sir,” (quoth she) “be not displeasd at all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who fares on sea may not commaund his way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne wind and weather at his pleasure call:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sea is wide, and easy for to stray;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The wind unstable, and doth never stay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But here a while ye may in safety rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till season serve new passage to assay:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Better safe port then be in seas distrest.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therewith she laught, and did her earnest end in jest,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But he, halfe discontent, mote nathelesse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Himselfe appease, and issewd forth on shore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The joyes whereof and happy fruitfulnesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such as he saw she gan him lay before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all, though pleasaunt, yet she made much more:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The fields did laugh, the flowres did freshly spring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The trees did bud, and early blossomes bore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the quire of birds did sweetly sing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And told that gardins pleasures in their caroling.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And she, more sweete then any bird on bough,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would oftentimes emongst them beare a part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And strive to passe (as she could well enough)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their native musicke by her skilful art:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So did she all that might his constant hart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Withdraw from thought of warlike enterprize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And drowne in dissolute delights apart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where noise of armes, or vew of martiall guize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Might not revive desire of knightly exercize.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But he was wise, and wary of her will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ever held his hand upon his hart;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet would not seeme so rude, and thewed ill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As to despise so curteous seeming part</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That gentle Lady did to him impart:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, fairly tempring, fond desire subdewd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ever her desired to depart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She list not heare, but her disports poursewd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ever bad him stay till time the tide renewd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And now by this Cymochles howre was spent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he awoke out of his ydle dreme;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, shaking off his drowsy dreriment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gan him avize, howe ill did him beseme</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In slouthfull sleepe his molten hart to steme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And quench the brond of his conceived yre:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tho up he started, stird with shame extreme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne staied for his Damsell to inquire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But marched to the Strond there passage to require.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And in the way he with Sir Guyon mett,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Accompanyde with Phædria the faire:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eftsoones he gan to rage, and inly frett,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Crying; “Let be that Lady debonaire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou recreaunt knight, and soone thyselfe prepaire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To batteile, if thou meane her love to gayn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Loe, loe! already how the fowles in aire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doe flocke, awaiting shortly to obtayn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy carcas for their pray, the guerdon of thy payn.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And therewithall he fiersly at him flew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with importune outrage him assayld;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, soone prepard to field, his sword forth drew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And him with equall valew countervayld:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their mightie strokes their haberjeons dismayld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And naked made each others manly spalles;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The mortall steele despiteously entayld</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Deepe in their flesh, quite through the yron walles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That a large purple streame adowne their giambeux falles.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Cymochles, that had never mett before</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So puissant foe, with envious despight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His prowd presumed force increased more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Disdeigning to bee held so long in fight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sir Guyon, grudging not so much his might</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As those unknightly raylinges which he spoke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With wrathfull fire his corage kindled bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereof devising shortly to be wroke,</span>

					<span>And doubling all his powres redoubled every stroke.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Both of them high attonce their handes enhaunst,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And both attonce their huge blowes down did sway.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cymochles sword on Guyons shield yglaunst,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thereof nigh one quarter sheard away;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Guyons angry blade so fiers did play</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On th’others helmett, which as Titan shone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That quite it clove his plumed crest in tway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And bared all his head unto the bone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherewith astonisht, still he stood as sencelesse stone.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Still as he stood, fayre Phædria, that beheld</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That deadly daunger, soone atweene them ran;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And at their feet her selfe most humbly feld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Crying with pitteous voyce, and count’nance wan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Ah, well away! most noble Lords, how can</span>

					<span class="i1">To shed your lives on ground? Wo worth the man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That first did teach the cursed steele to bight</span>

					<span>In his owne flesh, and make way to the living spright!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“If ever love of Lady did empierce</span>

					<span class="i1">Withhold your bloody handes from battaill fierce;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, sith for me ye fight, to me this grace</span>

					<span class="i1">Both yield, to stay your deadly stryfe a space.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They stayd a while, and forth she gan proceede:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Most wretched woman and of wicked race,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But, if for me ye fight, or me will serve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not this rude kynd of battaill, nor these armes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are meet, the which doe men in bale to sterve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And doolefull sorrow heape with deadly harmes:</span>

					<span class="i1">Without bloodshed, and where the enimy</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Debatefull strife, and cruell enmity,</span>

				<p>
					<span>Therewith she sweetly smyld. They, though full bent</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now after all was ceast, the Faery knight</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She no lesse glad then he desirous was</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And vaine delight she saw he light did pas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A foe of folly and immodest toy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still solemne sad, or still disdainfull coy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Delighting all in armes and cruell warre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That her sweet peace and pleasures did annoy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Troubled with terrour and unquiet jarre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she well pleased was thence to amove him farre.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tho him she brought abord, and her swift bote</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forthwith directed to that further strand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which on the dull waves did lightly flote,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And soone arrived on the shallow sand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where gladsome Guyon salied forth to land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to that Damsell thankes gave for reward.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon that shore he spyed Atin stand,</span>

					<span>In Phædrias flitt barck over that perlous shard.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Well could he him remember, sith of late</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He with Pyrochles sharp debatement made:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Streight gan he him revyle, and bitter rate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As Shepheardes curre, that in darke eveninges shade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hath tracted forth some salvage beastes trade:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Vile Miscreaunt,” (said he) “whither dost thou flye</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The shame and death, which will thee soone invade?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What coward hand shall doe thee next to dye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That art thus fowly fledd from famous enimy?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that he stifly shooke his steelhead dart:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But sober Guyon, hearing him so rayle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Though somewhat moved in his mightie hart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet with strong reason maistred passion fraile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And passed fayrely forth. He, turning taile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Back to the strond retyrd, and there still stayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Awaiting passage which him late did faile;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whiles Cymochles with that wanton mayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hasty heat of his avowd revenge delayd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whylest there the varlet stood, he saw from farre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An armed knight that towardes him fast ran;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He ran on foot, as if in lucklesse warre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His forlorne steed from him the victour wan:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He seemed breathlesse, hartlesse, faint, and wan;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all his armour sprinckled was with blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And soyld with durtie gore, that no man can</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Discerne the hew thereof. He never stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But bent his hastie course towardes the ydle flood.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The varlett saw, when to the flood he came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How without stop or stay he fiersly lept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And deepe him selfe beducked in the same,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in the lake his loftie crest was stept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne of his safetie seemed care he kept;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But with his raging armes he rudely flasht</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The waves about, and all his armour swept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all the blood and filth away was washt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet still he bet the water, and the billowes dasht.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Atin drew nigh to weet what it mote bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For much he wondred at that uncouth sight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom should he but his owne deare Lord there see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His owne deare Lord Pyrochles in sad plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ready to drowne him selfe for fell despight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Harrow now out, and well away!” he cryde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“What dismall day hath lent this cursed light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see my Lord so deadly damnifyde?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pyrochles, O Pyrochles! what is thee betyde?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“I burne, I burne, I burne!” then lowd he cryde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“O! how I burne with implacable fyre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet nought can quench mine inly flaming syde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor sea of licour cold, nor lake of myre:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nothing but death can doe me to respyre.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Ah! be it,” (said he) “from Pyrochles farre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After pursewing death once to requyre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or think, that ought those puissant hands may marre:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Death is for wretches borne under unhappy starre.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Perdye, then is it fitt for me,” (said he)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“That am, I weene, most wretched man alive;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Burning in flames, yet no flames can I see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And dying dayly, dayly yet revive.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O Atin! helpe to me last death to give.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The varlet at his plaint was grieved so sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That his deepe wounded hart in two did rive;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, his owne health remembring now no more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did follow that ensample which he blam’d afore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Into the lake he lept his Lord to ayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(So Love the dread of daunger doth despise)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of him catching hold him strongly stayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From drowning. But more happy he then wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that seas nature did him not avise:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The waves thereof so slow and sluggish were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Engrost with mud which did them fowle agrise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That every weighty thing they did upbeare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne ought mote ever sinck downe to the bottom there.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whiles thus they strugled in that ydle wave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And strove in vaine, the one him selfe to drowne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The other both from drowning for to save,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lo! to that shore one in an auncient gowne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose hoary locks great gravitie did crowne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Holding in hand a goodly arming sword,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By fortune came, ledd with the troublous sowne:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where drenched deepe he fownd in that dull ford</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The carefull servaunt stryving with his raging Lord.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Him Atin spying knew right well of yore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And lowdly cald; “Help, helpe! O Archimage!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To save my Lord in wretched plight forlore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Helpe with thy hand, or with thy counsell sage:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Weake handes, but counsell is most strong in age.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him when the old man saw, he wondred sore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see Pyrochles there so rudely rage;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet sithens helpe, he saw, he needed more</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then pitty, he in hast approched to the shore,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And cald; “Pyrochles! what is this I see?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What hellish fury hath at earst thee hent?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Furious ever I thee knew to bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet never in this straunge astonishment.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“These flames, these flames” (he cryde) “doe me torment.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“What flames,” (quoth he) “when I thee present see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In daunger rather to be drent then brent?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Harrow! the flames which me consume,” (said hee)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ne can be quencht, within my secret bowelles bee.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“That cursed man, that cruel feend of hell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Furor, oh! Furor hath me thus bedight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His deadly woundes within my liver swell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And his whott fyre burnes in mine entralles bright,</span>

					<span class="i1">Kindled through his infernall brond of spight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sith late with him I batteill vaine would boste;</span>

					<br/>
					<span>In flaming Phlegeton does not so felly roste.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when as Archimago heard, his griefe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He knew right well, and him attonce disarm’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then searcht his secret woundes, and made a priefe</span>

					<span>His yron cote, all overgrowne with rust,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well yet appeared to have beene of old</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Great heapes of gold that never could be spent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which some were rude owre, not purifide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Mulcibers devouring element;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some others were new driven, and distent</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some in round plates withouten moniment;</span>

					<span class="i1">That darest view my direfull countenaunce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I read thee rash and heedlesse of thy selfe,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sitting alone, his bitter lips did bight;</span>

					<span class="i1">And found no place wher safe he shroud him might:</span>

					<span class="i1">Of death and dolor telling sad tidings;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whiles sad Celeno, sitting on a clifte,</span>

				<p>
					<span>Before the dore sat selfe-consuming Care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Day and night keeping wary watch and ward,</span>

					<span class="i1">For feare least Force or Fraud should unaware</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Breake in, and spoile the treasure there in gard:</span>

				<p>
					<span>So soon as Mammon there arrivd, the dore</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Soone as he entred was, the dore streight way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did shutt, and from behind it forth there lept</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An ugly feend, more fowle then dismall day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which with monstrous stalke behind him stept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ever as he went dew watch upon him kept.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Well hoped hee, ere long that hardy guest,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or ever sleepe his eie-strings did untye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should be his pray. And therefore still on hye</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He over him did hold his cruell clawes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Threatning with greedy gripe to doe him dye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And rend in peeces with his ravenous pawes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If ever he transgrest the fatall Stygian lawes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>That houses forme within was rude and strong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lyke an huge cave hewne out of rocky clifte,</span>

					<span class="i1">Embost with massy gold of glorious guifte,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with rich metall loaded every rifte,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That heavy ruine they did seeme to threatt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And over them Arachne high did lifte</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her cunning web, and spred her subtile nett,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Enwrapped in fowle smoke and clouds more black then Jett.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Both roofe, and floore, and walls, were all of gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But overgrowne with dust and old decay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hid in darkenes, that none could behold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The hew thereof; for vew of cherefull day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did never in that house it selfe display,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But a faint shadow of uncertein light:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such as a lamp, whose life does fade away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or as the Moone, cloathed with clowdy night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Does show to him that walkes in feare and sad affright.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In all that rowme was nothing to be seene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But huge great yron chests, and coffers strong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All bard with double bends, that none could weene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Them to efforce by violence or wrong:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On every side they placed were along;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But all the grownd with sculs was scattered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And dead mens bones, which round about were flong;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose lives, it seemed, whilome there were shed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And their vile carcases now left unburied.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They forward passe; ne Guyon yet spoke word,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till that they came unto an yron dore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which to them opened of his owne accord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And shewd of richesse such exceeding store,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As eie of man did never see before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ever could within one place be fownd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Though all the wealth which is, or was of yore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could gathered be through all the world arownd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that above were added to that under grownd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The charge thereof unto a covetous Spright</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Commaunded was, who thereby did attend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And warily awaited day and night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From other covetous feends it to defend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who it to rob and ransacke did intend.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then Mammon, turning to that warriour, said;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Loe! here the worldes blis: loe! here the end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which al men doe ayme, rich to be made:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such grace now to be happy is before thee laid.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Certes,” (sayd he) “I n’ill thine offred grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne to be made so happy doe intend:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another blis before mine eyes I place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another happines, another end.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To them that list these base regardes I lend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But I in armes, and in atchievements brave,</span>

					<span class="i1">Do rather choose my flitting houres to spend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to be Lord of those that riches have,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then them to have my selfe, and be their servile sclave.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thereat the feend his gnashing teeth did grate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And griev’d so long to lacke his greedie pray;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For well he weened that so glorious bayte</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would tempt his guest to take thereof assay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had he so doen, he had him snatcht away,</span>

					<span class="i1">More light then Culver in the Faulcons fist.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eternall God thee save from such decay!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, whenas Mammon saw his purpose mist,</span>

					<span>Him to entrap unwares another way he wist.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thence forward he him ledd, and shortly brought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto another rowme, whose dore forthright</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To him did open, as it had beene taught.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therein an hundred raunges weren pight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hundred fournaces all burning bright:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By every fournace many feendes did byde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Deformed creatures, horrible in sight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And every feend his busie paines applyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To melt the golden metall, ready to be tryde.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One with great bellowes gathered filling ayre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with forst wind the fewell did inflame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another did the dying bronds repayre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With yron tongs, and sprinckled ofte the same</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With liquid waves, fiers Vulcans rage to tame,</span>

					<span class="i1">Yet had both life and sence, and well could weld</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That cursed weapon, when his cruell foes he queld.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Disdayne he called was, and did disdayne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be so cald, and who so did him call:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sterne was his looke, and full of stomacke vayne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His portaunce terrible, and stature tall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Far passing th’hight of men terrestriall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like an huge Gyant of the Titans race;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That made him scorne all creatures great and small,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with his pride all others powre deface:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More fitt emongst black fiendes then men to have his place.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Soone as those glitterand armes he did espye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with their brightnesse made that darknes light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His harmefull club he gan to hurtle hye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And threaten batteill to the Faery knight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who likewise gan himselfe to batteill dight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till Mammon did his hasty hand withhold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And counseld him abstaine from perilous fight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For nothing might abash the villein bold,</span>

					<span>Ne mortall steele emperce his miscreated mould.</span>
				</p>

					<span>So having him with reason pacifyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that fiers Carle commaunding to forbeare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He brought him in. The rowme was large and wyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As it some Gyeld or solemne Temple weare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Many great golden pillours did upbeare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The massy roofe, and riches huge sustayne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And every pillour decked was full deare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With crownes, and Diademes, and titles vaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which mortall Princes wore whiles they on earth did rayne.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A route of people there assembled were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of every sort and nation under skye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which with great uprore preaced to draw nere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To th’upper part, where was advaunced hye</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A stately siege of soveraine majestye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thereon satt a woman, gorgeous gay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And richly cladd in robes of royaltye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That never earthly Prince in such aray</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His glory did enhaunce, and pompous pryde display.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Her face right wondrous faire did seeme to bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That her broad beauties beam great brightnes threw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through the dim shade, that all men might it see:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet was not that same her owne native hew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But wrought by art and counterfetted shew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereby more lovers unto her to call:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nath’lesse most hevenly faire in deed and vew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She by creation was, till she did fall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thenceforth she sought for helps to cloke her crime withall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There, as in glistring glory she did sitt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She held a great gold chaine ylincked well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose upper end to highest heven was knitt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And lower part did reach to lowest Hell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all that preace did rownd about her swell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To catchen hold of that long chaine, thereby</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To climbe aloft, and others to excell:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That was Ambition, rash desire to sty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every linck thereof a step of dignity.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Some thought to raise themselves to high degree</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By riches and unrighteous reward;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some by close shouldring; some by flatteree;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Others through friendes; others for base regard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all by wrong waies for themselves prepard:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those that were up themselves kept others low;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those that were low themselves held others hard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne suffred them to ryse or greater grow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But every one did strive his fellow downe to throw.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which whenas Guyon saw, he gan inquire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What meant that preace about that Ladies throne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And what she was that did so high aspyre?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him Mammon answered; “That goodly one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom all that folke with such contention</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doe flock about, my deare, my daughter is:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Honour and dignitie from her alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Derived are, and all this worldes blis,</span>

					<span>For which ye men doe strive; few gett, but many mis:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“And fayre Philotime she rightly hight,</span>

					<span class="i1">Thy spouse I will her make, if that thou lust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she may thee advance for works and merits just.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Gramercy, Mammon,” (said the gentle knight)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“For so great grace and offred high estate;</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Mammon emmoved was with inward wrath;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet, forcing it to fayne, him forth thence ledd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through griesly shadowes by a beaten path,</span>

				<p>
					<span>There mournfull Cypresse grew in greatest store,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Emongst the rest of those same ruefull sightes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One cursed creature he by chaunce espide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That drenched lay full deepe under the Garden side.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Deepe was he drenched to the upmost chin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet gaped still as coveting to drinke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the cold liquor which he waded in;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And stretching forth his hand did often thinke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To reach the fruit which grew upon the brincke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But both the fruit from hand, and flood from mouth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did fly abacke, and made him vainely swincke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whiles he sterv’d with hunger, and with drouth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He daily dyde, yet never throughly dyen couth.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The knight, him seeing labour so in vaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ask’t who he was, and what he ment thereby?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, groning deepe, thus answerd him againe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Most cursed of all creatures under skye,</span>

					<span class="i1">Lo! here I now for want of food doe dye:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, if that thou be such as I thee see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of grace I pray thee, give to eat and drinke to mee!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Nay, nay, thou greedy Tantalus,” (quoth he)</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then gan the cursed wretch alowd to cry,</span>

					<span class="i1">Accusing highest Jove and gods ingrate;</span>

					<span class="i1">Yet nothing cleaner were for such intent,</span>

					<span class="i1">But rather fowler seemed to the eye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So lost his labour vaine and ydle industry.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The knight him calling asked who he was?</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Infinite moe tormented in like paine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He there beheld, too long here to be told:</span>

					<span class="i1">For terrour of the tortures manifold,</span>

					<span>To rest thy weary person in the shadow coole?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All which he did to do him deadly fall</span>

					<span class="i1">In frayle intemperaunce through sinfull bayt;</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His snowy front, curled with golden heares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like Phœbus face adornd with sunny rayes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Divinely shone; and two sharpe winged sheares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Decked with diverse plumes, like painted Jayes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were fixed at his backe to cut his ayery wayes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like as Cupido on Idæan hill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When having laid his cruell bow away</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And mortall arrowes, wherewith he doth fill</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The world with murdrous spoiles and bloody pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With his faire mother he him dights to play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with his goodly sisters, Graces three:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Goddesse, pleased with his wanton play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Suffers her selfe through sleepe beguild to bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The whiles the other Ladies mind theyr mery glee.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whom when the Palmer saw, abasht he was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through fear and wonder that he nought could say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till him the childe bespoke; “Long lackt, alas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hath bene thy faithfull aide in hard assay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whiles deadly fitt thy pupill doth dismay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behold this heavy sight, thou reverend Sire!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But dread of death and dolor doe away;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For life ere long shall to her home retire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he that breathlesse seems shal corage both respire.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The charge, which God doth unto me arrett,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his deare safety, I to thee commend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet will I not forgoe, ne yet forgett</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The care thereof my selfe unto the end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But evermore him succour, and defend</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against his foe and mine: watch thou, I pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For evill is at hand him to offend.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So having said, eftsoones he gan display</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His painted nimble wings, and vanisht quite away,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Palmer seeing his lefte empty place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And his slow eies beguiled of their sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Woxe sore affraid, and standing still a space</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gaz’d after him, as fowle escapt by flight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At last, him turning to his charge behight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With trembling hand his troubled pulse gan try;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where finding life not yet dislodged quight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He much rejoyst, and courd it tenderly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As chicken newly hatcht, from dreaded destiny.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At last he spide where towards him did pace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Two Paynim knights al armd as bright as skie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And them beside an aged Sire did trace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And far before a light-foote Page did flie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That breathed strife and troublous enmitie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those were the two sonnes of Acrates old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, meeting earst with Archimago slie</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Foreby that idle strond, of him were told</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he which earst them combatted was Guyon bold.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which to avenge on him they dearly vowd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where ever that on ground they mote him find:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">False Archimage provokte their corage prowd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And stryful Atin in their stubborne mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Coles of contention and whot vengeaunce tind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now bene they come whereas the Palmer sate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Keeping that slombred corse to him assind:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well knew they both his person, sith of late</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With him in bloody armes they rashly did debate.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whom when Pyrochles saw, inflam’d with rage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That sire he fowl bespake: “Thou dotard vile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with thy brutenesse shendst thy comely age,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Abandon soone, I read, the caytive spoile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that same outcast carcas, that erewhile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made it selfe famous through false trechery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And crownd his coward crest with knightly stile;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Loe! where he now inglorious doth lye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To proove he lived il that did thus fowly dye.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To whom the Palmer fearlesse answered:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Certes, Sir knight, ye bene too much to blame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus for to blott the honor of the dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with fowle cowardize his carcas shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose living handes immortalizd his name.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vile is the vengeaunce on the ashes cold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And envy base to barke at sleeping fame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was never wight that treason of him told:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your self his prowesse prov’d, and found him fiers and bold.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then sayd Cymochles: “Palmer, thou doest dote,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne canst of prowesse ne of knighthood deeme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Save as thou seest or hearst. But well I wote,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That of his puissaunce tryall made extreeme:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet gold al is not that doth golden seeme;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne all good knights that shake well speare and shield.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The worth of all men by their end esteeme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then dew praise or dew reproch them yield;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bad therefore I him deeme that thus lies dead on field.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Good or bad,” gan his brother fiers reply,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“What doe I recke, sith that he dide entire?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or what doth his bad death now satisfy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The greedy hunger of revenging yre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sith wrathfull hand wrought not her owne desire?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet since no way is lefte to wreake my spight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I will him reave of armes, the victors hire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of that shield, more worthy of good knight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For why should a dead dog be deckt in armour bright?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Fayr Sir,” said then the Palmer suppliaunt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“For knighthoods love doe not so fowle a deed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne blame your honor with so shamefull vaunt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of vile revenge. To spoile the dead of weed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is sacrilege, and doth all sinnes exceed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But leave these relicks of his living might</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To decke his herce, and trap his tomb-blacke steed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“What herce or steed” (said he) “should he have dight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But be entombed in the raven or the kight?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that, rude hand upon his shield he laid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And th’other brother gan his helme unlace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both fiercely bent to have him disaraid;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till that they spyde where towards them did pace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An armed knight, of bold and bounteous grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose squire bore after him an heben launce</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And coverd shield. Well kend him so far space</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Th’enchaunter by his armes and amenaunce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When under him he saw his Lybian steed to praunce;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And to those brethren sayd; “Rise, rise by live,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And unto batteil doe your selves addresse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For yonder comes the prowest knight alive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Prince Arthur, flowre of grace and nobilesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That hath to Paynim knights wrought gret distresse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thousand Sar’zins fowly donne to dye.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That word so deepe did in their harts impresse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That both eftsoones upstarted furiously,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gan themselves prepare to batteill greedily.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But fiers Pyrochles, lacking his owne sword,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The want thereof now greatly gan to plaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Archimage besought, him that afford</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which he had brought for Braggadochio vaine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“So would I,” (said th’enchaunter) “glad and faine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beteeme to you this sword, you to defend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or ought that els your honour might maintaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that this weapons powre I well have kend</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be contrary to the worke which ye intend:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“For that same knights owne sword this is, of yore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which Merlin made by his almightie art</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For that his noursling, when he knighthood swore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therewith to doen his foes eternall smart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The metall first he mixt with Medæwart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That no enchauntment from his dint might save;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then it in flames of Aetna wrought apart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And seven times dipped in the bitter wave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of hellish Styx, which hidden vertue to it gave.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The vertue is, that nether steele nor stone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The stroke thereof from entraunce may defend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ever may be used by his fone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne forst his rightful owner to offend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ever will it breake, ne ever bend:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore <em>Morddure</em> it rightfully is hight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In vaine therefore, Pyrochles, should I lend</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The same to thee, against his lord to fight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For sure yt would deceive thy labor and thy might.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Foolish old man,” said then the Pagan wroth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“That weenest words or charms may force withstond:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Soone shalt thou see, and then beleeve for troth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I can carve with this inchaunted brond</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His Lords owne flesh.” Therewith out of his hond</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That vertuous steele he rudely snatcht away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Guyons shield about his wrest he bond:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So ready dight fierce battaile to assay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And match his brother proud in battailous aray.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>By this, that straunger knight in presence came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And goodly salued them; who nought againe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him answered, as courtesie became;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But with sterne lookes, and stomachous disdaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gave signes of grudge and discontentment vaine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then, turning to the Palmer, he gan spy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where at his feet, with sorrowfull demayne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And deadly hew, an armed corse did lye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In whose dead face he redd great magnanimity.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sayd he then to the Palmer: “Reverend Syre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What great misfortune hath betidd this knight?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or did his lire her fatall date expyre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or did he fall by treason, or by fight?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How ever, sure I rew his pitteous plight.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Not one, nor other,” sayd the Palmer grave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Hath him befalne; but cloudes of deadly night</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A while his heavy eylids cover’d have,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all his sences drowned in deep sencelesse wave:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Which those his cruell foes, that stand hereby,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Making advauntage, to revenge their spight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would him disarme and treaten shamefully;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unworthie usage of redoubted knight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But you, faire Sir, whose honourable sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth promise hope of helpe and timely grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mote I beseech to succour his sad plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by your powre protect his feeble cace?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>First prayse of knighthood is fowle outrage to deface.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Palmer,” (said he) “no knight so rude, I weene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As to doen outrage to a sleeping ghost;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne was there ever noble corage seene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in advauntage would his puissaunce bost:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Honour is least where oddes appeareth most.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">May bee, that better reason will aswage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The rash revengers heat. Words, well dispost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have secrete powre t’appease inflamed rage:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If not, leave unto me thy knights last patronage.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tho, turning to those brethren, thus bespoke:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Ye warlike payre, whose valorous great might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It seemes, just wronges to vengeaunce doe provoke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To wreake your wrath on this dead seeming knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mote ought allay the storme of your despight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And settle patience in so furious heat?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not to debate the chalenge of your right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But for his carkas pardon I entreat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whom fortune hath already laid in lowest seat.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To whom Cymochles said; “For what art thou,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That mak’st thy selfe his dayes-man, to prolong</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The vengeaunce prest? Or who shall let me now</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On this vile body from to wreak my wrong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And make his carkas as the outcast dong?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Why should not that dead carrion satisfye</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The guilt which, if he lived had thus long,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His life for dew revenge should deare abye?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The trespass still doth live, albee the person dye.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Indeed,” then said the Prince, “the evill donne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dyes not, when breath the body first doth leave;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But from the grandsyre to the Nephewes sonne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all his seede the curse doth often cleave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till vengeaunce utterly the guilt bereave:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So streightly God doth judge. But gentle Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That doth against the dead his hand upheave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His honour staines with rancour and despight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And great disparagment makes to his former might.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Pyrochles gan reply the second tyme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to him said: “Now, felon, sure I read,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How that thou art partaker of his cryme:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore, by Termagaunt thou shalt be dead.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With that his hand, more sad then lomp of lead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uplifting high, he weened with Morddure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His owne good sword Morddure, to cleave his head.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The faithfull steele such treason no’uld endure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, swarving from the marke, his Lordes life did assure.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet was the force so furious and so fell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That horse and man it made to reele asyde:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nath’lesse the Prince would not forsake his sell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For well of yore he learned had to ryde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But full of anger fiersly to him cryde;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“False traitour! miscreaunt! thou broken hast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The law of armes to strike foe undefide:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But thou thy treasons fruit, I hope, shalt taste</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right sowre, and feele the law the which thou hast defast.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that his balefull speare he fiercely bent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against the Pagans brest, and therewith thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His cursed life out of her lodge have rent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But ere the point arrived where it ought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That seven fold shield, which he from Guyon brought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He cast between to ward the bitter stownd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through all those foldes the steelehead passage wrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And through his shoulder perst; wherwith to ground</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He groveling fell, all gored in his gushing wound.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when his brother saw, fraught with great griefe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wrath, he to him leaped furiously,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fowly saide: “By Mahoune, cursed thiefe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That direfull stroke thou dearely shalt aby:”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then, hurling up his harmefull blade on hy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Smote him so hugely on his haughtie crest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That from his saddle forced him to fly;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Els mote it needes downe to his manly brest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have cleft his head in twaine, and life thence dispossest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now was the Prince in daungerous distresse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wanting his sword when he on foot should fight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His single speare could doe him small redresse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against two foes of so exceeding might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The least of which was match for any knight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now the other, whom he earst did daunt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had reard him selfe againe to cruel fight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Three times more furious and more puissaunt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unmindfull of his wound, of his fate ignoraunt.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So both attonce him charge on either syde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With hideous strokes and importable powre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That forced him his ground to traverse wyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wisely watch to ward that deadly stowre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For in his shield, as thicke as stormie showre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their strokes did raine: yet did he never quaile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne backward shrinke, but as a stedfast towre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom foe with double battry doth assaile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Them on her bulwarke beares, and bids them nought availe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So stoutly he withstood their strong assay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till that at last, when he advantage spyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His poynant speare he thrust with puissant sway</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At proud Cymochles, whiles his shield was wyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That through his thigh the mortall steele did gryde:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He, swarving with the force, within his flesh</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did breake the launce, and let the head abyde.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of the wound the red blood flowed fresh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That underneath his feet soone made a purple plesh.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Horribly then he gan to rage and rayle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cursing his Gods, and him selfe damning deepe:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Als when his brother saw the red blood rayle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Adowne so fast, and all his armour steepe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For very felnesse lowd he gan to weepe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said; “Caytive, curse on thy cruell hond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That twise hath spedd; yet shall it not thee keepe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the third brunt of this my fatall brond:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo! where the dreadfull Death behynd thy backe doth stond.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that he strooke, and thother strooke withall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That nothing seemd mote beare so monstrous might:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The one upon his covered shield did fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And glauncing downe would not his owner byte;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But thother did upon his troncheon smyte,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which hewing quite asunder, further way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It made, and on his hacqueton did lyte,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which dividing with importune sway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seizd in his right side, and there the dint did stay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Wyde was the wound, and a large lukewarme flood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Red as the Rose, thence gushed grievously;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That when the Paynym spyde the streaming blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gave him great hart and hope of victory.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On th’other side, in huge perplexity</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Prince now stood, having his weapon broke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nought could he hurt, but still at warde did ly:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet with his troncheon he so rudely stroke</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cymochles twise, that twise him forst his foot revoke.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whom when the Palmer saw in such distresse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sir Guyon’s sword he lightly to him raught,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said; “Fayre Sonne, great God thy right hand blesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To use that sword so well as he it ought!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Glad was the knight, and with fresh courage fraught,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When as againe he armed felt his hond:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then like a Lyon, which hath long time saught</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His robbed whelpes, and at the last them fond</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Emongst the shepeheard swaynes, then wexeth wood and yond:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So fierce he laid about him, and dealt blowes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On either side, that neither mayle could hold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne shield defend the thunder of his throwes:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now to Pyrochles many strokes he told;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eft to Cymochles twise so many fold;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then, backe againe turning his busie hond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Them both atonce compeld with courage bold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To yield wide way to his hart-thrilling brond;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And though they both stood stiffe, yet could not both withstond.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As salvage Bull, whom two fierce mastives bayt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When rancour doth with rage him once engore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forgets with wary warde them to awayt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But with his dreadfull hornes them drives afore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or flings aloft, or treades downe in the flore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Breathing out wrath, and bellowing disdaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all the forest quakes to heare him rore:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So rag’d Prince Arthur twixt his foemen twaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That neither could his mightie puissaunce sustaine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But ever at Pyrochles when he smitt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(Who Guyons shield cast ever him before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereon the Faery Queenes pourtract was writt,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His hand relented and the stroke forbore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And his deare hart the picture gan adore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which oft the Paynim sav’d from deadly stowre:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But him henceforth the same can save no more;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For now arrived is his fatall howre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That no’te avoyded be by earthly skill or powre.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For when Cymochles saw the fowle reproch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which them appeached, prickt with guiltie shame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And inward griefe, he fiercely gan approch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Resolv’d to put away that loathly blame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or dye with honour and desert of fame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on the haubergh stroke the Prince so sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That quite disparted all the linked frame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And pierced to the skin, but bit no more;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet made him twise to reele, that never moov’d afore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whereat renfierst with wrath and sharp regret,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He stroke so hugely with his borrowd blade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it empierst the Pagans burganet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, cleaving the hard steele, did deepe invade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into his head, and cruell passage made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Quite through his brayne. He, tombling downe on ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Breathd out his ghost, which, to th’infernall shade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fast flying, there eternall torment found</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all the sinnes wherewith his lewd life did abound.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which, when his german saw, the stony feare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ran to his hart, and all his sence dismayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne thenceforth life ne corage did appeare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But as a man whom hellish feendes have frayd,</span>

					<span class="i1">Long trembling still he stoode: at last thus sayd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Traytour, what hast thou doen? How ever may</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy cursed hand so cruelly have swayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against that knight! Harrow and well away!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After so wicked deede why liv’st thou lenger day?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that all desperate, as loathing light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with revenge desyring soone to dye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Assembling all his force and utmost might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With his owne swerd he fierce at him did flye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And strooke, and foynd, and lasht outrageously,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Withouten reason or regard. Well knew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Prince, with pacience and sufferaunce sly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So hasty heat soone cooled to subdew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tho, when this breathlesse woxe, that batteil gan renew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As when a windy tempest bloweth hye,</span>

					<span class="i1">That nothing may withstand his stormy stowre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The clowdes, as thinges affrayd, before him flye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But all so soone as his outrageous powre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is layd, they fiercely then begin to showre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, as in scorne of his spent stormy spight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now all attonce their malice forth do poure:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So did Prince Arthur beare himselfe in fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And suffred rash Pyrochles waste his ydle might.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At last, when as the Sarazin perceiv’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How that straunge sword refusd to serve his neede,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when he stroke most strong the dint deceiv’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He flong it from him; and, devoyd of dreed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon him lightly leaping without heed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Twixt his two mighty armes engrasped fast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thinking to overthrowe and downe him tred:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But him in strength and skill the Prince surpast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And through his nimble sleight did under him down cast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nought booted it the Paynim then to strive;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For as a Bittur in the Eagles clawe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That may not hope by flight to scape alive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still waytes for death with dread and trembling aw;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So he, now subject to the victours law,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did not once move, nor upward cast his eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For vile disdaine and rancour, which did gnaw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His hart in twaine with sad melancholy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As one that loathed life, and yet despysd to dye.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But full of princely bounty and great mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Conquerour nought cared him to slay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But casting wronges and all revenge behind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More glory thought to give life then decay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sayd; “Paynim, this is thy dismall day;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet if thou wilt renounce thy miscreaunce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And my trew liegeman yield thy selfe for ay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Life will I graunt thee for thy valiaunce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all thy wronges will wipe out of my sovenaunce.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Foole!” (sayd the Pagan) “I thy gift defye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But use thy fortune as it doth befall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And say, that I not overcome doe dye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But in despight of life for death doe call.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wroth was the Prince, and sory yet withall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he so wilfully refused grace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet sith his fate so cruelly did fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His shining Helmet he gan soone unlace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And left his headlesse body bleeding all the place.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>By this Sir Guyon from his traunce awakt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Life having maystered her sencelesse foe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And looking up, whenas his shield he lakt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sword saw not, he wexed wondrous woe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when the Palmer, whom he long ygoe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had lost, he by him spyde, right glad he grew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And saide; “Deare sir, whom wandring to and fro</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I long have lackt, I joy thy face to vew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Firme is thy faith, whom daunger never fro me drew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But read, what wicked hand hath robbed mee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of my good sword and shield?” The Palmer glad</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With so fresh hew uprysing him to see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him answered: “Fayre sonne, be no whit sad</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For want of weapons; they shall soone be had.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So gan he to discourse the whole debate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which that straunge knight for him sustained had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And those two Sarazins confounded late,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose carcases on ground were horribly prostrate.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when he heard, and saw the tokens trew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His hart with great affection was embayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to the Prince, bowing with reverence dew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As to the patrone of his life, thus sayd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“My Lord, my liege, by whose most gratious ayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I live this day, and see my foes subdewd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What may suffice to be for meede repayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of so great graces as ye have me shewd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to be ever bound”⁠—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To whom the Infant thus; “Fayre Sir, what need</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Good turnes be counted as a servile bond</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To bind their dooers to receive their meed?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are not all knightes by oath bound to withstond</span>

					<span class="i1">Oppressours powre by armes and puissant hond?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Suffise that I have done my dew in place.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So goodly purpose they together fond</span>

					<span class="i1">His weary wagon to the Westerne vale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whenas they spide a goodly castle, plaste</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Foreby a river in a pleasaunt dale;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which choosing for that evenings hospitale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They thither marcht: but when they came in sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from their sweaty Coursers did avale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They found the gates fast barred long ere night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every loup fast lockt, as fearing foes despight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when they saw, they weened fowle reproch</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was to them doen, their entraunce to forestall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till that the Squire gan nigher to approch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wind his horne under the castle wall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with the noise it shooke as it would fall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eftsoones forth looked from the highest spire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The watch, and lowd unto the knights did call,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To weete what they so rudely did require?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who gently answered, They entraunce did desire.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Fly fly, good knights,” (said he) “fly fast away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If that your lives ye love, as meete ye should;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fly fast, and save your selves from neare decay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here may ye not have entraunce, though we would:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We would, and would againe, if that we could;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But thousand enemies about us rave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with long siege us in the castle hould.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seven yeares this wize they us besieged have,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And many good knights slaine that have us sought to save.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus as he spoke, loe! with outragious cry</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A thousand villeins rownd about them swarmd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of the rockes and caves adjoyning nye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vile caitive wretches, ragged, rude, deformd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All threatning death, all in straunge manner armd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some with unweldy clubs, some with long speares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some rusty knifes, some staves in fier warmd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sterne was their looke; like wild amazed steares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Staring with hollow eies, and stiffe upstanding heares.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Fiersly at first those knights they did assayle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And drove them to recoile; but when againe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They gave fresh charge, their forces gan to fayle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unhable their encounter to sustaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For with such puissaunce and impetuous maine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those Champions broke on them, that forst them fly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like scattered Sheepe, whenas the Shepherds swaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A Lyon and a Tigre doth espye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With greedy pace forth rushing from the forest nye.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A while they fled, but soone retournd againe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With greater fury then before was fownd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And evermore their cruell Capitaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sought with his raskall routs t’enclose them rownd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, overronne, to tread them to the grownd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But soone the knights with their bright burning blades</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Broke their rude troupes, and orders did confownd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hewing and slashing at their idle shades;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For though they bodies seem, yet substaunce from them fades.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As when a swarme of Gnats at eventide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of the fennes of Allan doe arise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their murmuring small trompetts sownden wide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whiles in the aire their clustring army flies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That as a cloud doth seeme to dim the skies;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne man nor beast may rest, or take repast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For their sharpe wounds and noyous injuries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till the fierce Northerne wind with blustring blast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Doth blow them quite away, and in the Ocean cast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus when they had that troublous rout disperst,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the castle gate they come againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And entraunce crav’d which was denied erst.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now when report of that their perlous paine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And combrous conflict which they did sustaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came to the Ladies eare which there did dwell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shee forth issewed with a goodly traine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Squires and Ladies equipaged well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And entertained them right fairely, as befell.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Alma she called was; a virgin bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That had not yet felt Cupides wanton rage;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet was shee woo’d or many a gentle knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And many a Lord of noble parentage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That sought with her to lincke in marriage:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For shee was faire as faire mote ever bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in the flowre now of her freshest age;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet full of grace and goodly modestee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That even heven rejoyced her sweete face to see.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In robe of lilly white she was arayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That from her shoulder to her heele downe raught;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The traine whereof loose far behind her strayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Braunched with gold and perle most richly wrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And borne of two faire Damsels which were taught</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That service well. Her yellow golden heare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was trimly woven and in tresses wrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne other tire she on her head did weare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But crowned with a garland of sweete Rosiere.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Goodly shee entertaind those noble knights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And brought them up into her castle hall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where gentle court and gracious delight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shee to them made, with mildnesse virginall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shewing her selfe both wise and liberall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then, when they rested had a season dew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They her besought of favour speciall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that faire Castle to affoord them vew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shee graunted; and, them leading forth, the same did shew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>First she them led up to the Castle wall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That was so high as foe might not it clime,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all so faire and fensible withall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not built of bricke, ne yet of stone and lime,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But of thing like to that Ægyptian slime,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereof king Nine whilome built Babell towre.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But O great pitty! that no lenger time</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So goodly workemanship should not endure:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soone it must turne to earth; no earthly thing is sure.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The frame thereof seemd partly circulare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And part triangulare; O worke divine!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those two the first and last proportions are;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The one imperfect, mortall, fœminine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Th’other immortall, perfect, masculine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And twixt them both a quadrate was the base,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Proportiond equally by seven and nine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nine was the circle sett in heavens place:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All which compacted made a goodly Diapase.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Therein two gates were placed seemly well:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The one before, by which all in did pas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did th’other far in workmanship excell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For not of wood, nor of enduring bras,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But of more worthy substance fram’d it was:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doubly disparted, it did locke and close,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That when it locked none might thorough pas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And when it opened, no man might it close,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still open to their friendes, and closed to their foes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Of hewen stone the porch was fayrely wrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stone more of valew, and more smooth and fine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then Jett or Marble far from Ireland brought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Over the which was cast a wandring vine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Enchaced with a wanton yvie twine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And over it a fayre Portcullis hong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which to the gate directly did incline</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With comely compasse and compacture strong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nether unseemly short, nor yet exceeding long.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Within the Barbican a Porter sate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Day and night duely keeping watch and ward;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor wight nor word mote passe out of the gate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But in good order, and with dew regard;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Utterers of secrets he from thence debard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bablers of folly, and blazers of cryme:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His larumbell might lowd and wyde be hard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When cause requyrd, but never out of time;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Early and late it rong, at evening and at prime.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And rownd about the porch on every syde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Twise sixteene warders satt, all armed bright</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In glistring steele, and strongly fortifyde:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tall yeomen seemed they and of great might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And were enraunged ready still for fight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By them as Alma passed with her guestes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They did obeysaunce, as beseemed right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then againe retourned to their restes:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Porter eke to her did lout with humble gestes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thence she them brought into a stately Hall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherein were many tables fayre dispred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ready dight with drapets festivall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against the viaundes should be ministred.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At th’upper end there sate, yclad in red</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Downe to the ground, a comely personage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in his hand a white rod menaged:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He Steward was, hight Diet; rype of age,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in demeanure sober, and in counsell sage.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And through the Hall there walked to and fro</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A jolly yeoman, Marshall of the same,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose name was Appetite: he did bestow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both guestes and meate, when ever in they came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And knew them how to order without blame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As him the Steward badd. They both attone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did dewty to their Lady, as became;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, passing by, forth ledd her guestes anone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the kitchin rowme, ne spard for nicenesse none.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It was a vaut ybuilt for great dispence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With many raunges reard along the wall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And one great chimney, whose long tonnell thence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The smoke forth threw. And in the midst of all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There placed was a caudron wide and tall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon a mightie fornace, burning whott,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More whott then Aetn’, or flaming Mongiball;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For day and night it brent, ne ceased not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So long as any thing it in the caudron gott.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But to delay the heat, least by mischaunce</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It might breake out and set the whole on fvre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There added was by goodly ordinaunce</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An huge great payre of bellowes, which did styre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Continually, and cooling breath inspyre.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">About the Caudron many Cookes accoyld</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With hookes and ladles, as need did requyre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whyles the viaundes in the vessell boyld</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They did about their businesse sweat, and sorely toyld.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The maister Cooke was cald Concoction;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A carefull man, and full of comely guyse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The kitchin clerke, that hight Digestion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did order all th’Achates in seemely wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And set them forth, as well he could devise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The rest had severall offices assynd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some to remove the scum as it did rise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Others to beare the same away did mynd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And others it to use according to his kynd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But all the liquour, which was fowle and waste,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not good nor serviceable elles for ought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They in another great rownd vessell plaste,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till by a conduit pipe it thence were brought:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the rest, that noyous was and nought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By secret wayes, that none might it espy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was close convaid, and to the backgate brought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That cleped was Port Esquiline, whereby</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It was avoided quite, and throwne out privily.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which goodly order and great workmans skill</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whenas those knightes beheld, with rare delight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gazing wonder they their mindes did fill;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For never had they seene so straunge a sight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thence backe againe faire Alma led them right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And soone into a goodly Parlour brought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That was with royall arras richly dight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which was nothing pourtrahed nor wrought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not wrought nor pourtrahed, but easie to be thought.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And in the midst thereof upon the floure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A lovely bevy of faire Ladies sate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Courted of many a jolly Paramoure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which them did in modest wise amate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And each one sought his Lady to aggrate:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke emongst them litle Cupid playd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His wanton sportes, being retourned late</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From his fierce warres, and having from him layd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His cruel bow, wherewith he thousands hath dismayd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Diverse delights they fownd them selves to please;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some song in sweet consort; some laught for joy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some plaid with strawes; some ydly satt at ease;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But other some could not abide to toy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All pleasaunce was to them griefe and annoy:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This fround, that faund, the third for shame did blush,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another seemed envious or coy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another in her teeth did gnaw a rush;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But at these straungers presence every one did hush.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Soone as the gracious Alma came in place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They all attonce out of their seates arose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to her homage made with humble grace:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom when the knights beheld, they gan dispose</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Themselves to court, and each a damzell chose.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Prince by chaunce did on a Lady light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That was right faire and fresh as morning rose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But somwhat sad and solemne eke in sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if some pensive thought constraind her gentle spright.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In a long purple pall, whose skirt with gold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was fretted all about, she was arayd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in her hand a Poplar braunch did hold:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom the Prince in courteous maner sayd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Gentle Madame, why beene ye thus dismayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And your faire beautie doe with sadnes spill?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lives any that you hath thus ill apayd?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or doen you love? or doen you lack your will?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What ever bee the cause, it sure beseemes you ill.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Fayre Sir,” said she, halfe in disdaineful wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“How is it that this mood in me ye blame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in your selfe doe not the same advise?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him ill beseemes anothers fault to name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That may unwares bee blotted with the same:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pensive I yeeld I am, and sad in mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through great desire of glory and of fame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ought, I weene, are ye therein behynd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That have three years sought one, yet no where can her find.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Prince was inly moved at her speach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well weeting trew what she had rashly told;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet with faire semblaunt sought to hyde the breach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which chaunge of colour did perforce unfold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now seeming flaming whott, now stony cold:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tho, turning soft aside, he did inquyre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What wight she was that Poplar braunch did hold?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It answered was, her name was Prays-desire,</span>

					<span>That by well doing sought to honour to aspyre.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The whyles the Faery knight did entertayne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another Damsell of that gentle crew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That was right fayre and modest of demayne,</span>

					<span class="i1">But that too oft she chaung’d her native hew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Straunge was her tyre, and all her garment blew,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So long as Guyon with her commoned,</span>

					<span class="i1">The bashfull blood her snowy cheekes did dye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That her became, as polisht yvory</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which cunning Craftesman hand hath overlayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With fayre vermilion or pure Castory.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Great wonder had the knight to see the mayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So straungely passioned, and to her gently said:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Fayre Damzell, seemeth by your troubled cheare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That either me too bold ye weene, this wise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">You to molest, or other ill to feare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in the secret of your hart close lyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From whence it doth, as cloud from sea, aryse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If it be I, of pardon I you pray;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But if ought else that I mote not devyse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I will, if please you it discure, assay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To ease you of that ill, so wisely as I may.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She answerd nought, but more abasht for shame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Held downe her head, the whiles her lovely face</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The flashing blood with blushing did inflame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the strong passion mard her modest grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Guyon mervayld at her uncouth cace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till Alma him bespake: “Why wonder yee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Faire Sir, at that which ye so much embrace?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She is the fountaine of your modestee:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You shamefast are, but Shamefastnes it selfe is shee.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thereat the Elfe did blush in privitee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And turnd his face away; but she the same</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dissembled faire, and faynd to oversee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus they awhile with court and goodly game</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Themselves did solace each one with his Dame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till that great Lady thence away them sought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To vew her Castles other wondrous frame:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up to a stately Turret she them brought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ascending by ten steps of Alabaster wrought.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>That Turrets frame most admirable was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like highest heaven compassed around,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And lifted high above this earthly masse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which it survewd as hils doen lower ground;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But not on ground mote like to this be found:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not that, which antique Cadmus whylome built</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In Thebes, which Alexander did confound;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor that proud towre of Troy, though richly guilt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From which young Hectors blood by cruell Greekes was spilt.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The roofe hereof was arched over head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And deckt with flowers and herbars daintily:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Two goodly Beacons, set in watches stead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therein gave light, and flamd continually;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For they of living fire most subtilly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were made, and set in silver sockets bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cover’d with lids deviz’d of substance sly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That readily they shut and open might.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O! who can tell the prayses of that makers might?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ne can I tell, ne can I stay to tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This parts great workemanship and wondrous powre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all this other worldes worke doth excell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And likest is unto that heavenly towre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That God hath built for his owne blessed bowre.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therein were divers rowmes, and divers stages;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But three the chiefest and of greatest powre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which there dwelt three honorable sages,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wisest men, I weene, that lived in their ages.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Not he, whom Greece, the Nourse of all good arts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By Phœbus doome the wisest thought alive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Might be compar’d to these by many parts:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor that sage Pylian syre, which did survive</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Three ages, such as mortall men contrive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By whose advise old Priams cittie fell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With these in praise of pollicies mote strive.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These three in these three rowmes did sondry dwell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And counselled faire Alma how to governe well.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The first of them could things to come foresee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The next could of thinges present best advize;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The third things past could keep in memoree:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that no time nor reason could arize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that the same could one of these comprize.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forthy the first did in the forepart sit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That nought mote hinder his quicke prejudize:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He had a sharpe foresight and working wit</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That never idle was, ne once would rest a whit.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His chamber was dispainted all within</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With sondry colours, in the which were writ</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Infinite shapes of thinges dispersed thin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some such as in the world were never yit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne can devized be of mortall wit;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some daily seene and knowen by their names,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such as in idle fantasies do flit;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Infernall Hags, Centaurs, feendes, Hippodames,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Apes, Lyons, Aegles, Owles, fooles, lovers, children, Dames.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And all the chamber filled was with flyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which buzzed all about, and made such sound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That they encombred all mens eares and eyes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like many swarmes of Bees assembled round,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After their hives with honny do abound.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All those were idle thoughtes and fantasies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Devices, dreames, opinions unsound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shewes, visions, soothsayes, and prophesies;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all that fained is, as leasings, tales, and lies.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Emongst them all sate he which wonned there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That hight Phantastes by his nature trew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A man of yeares yet fresh, as mote appere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of swarth complexion, and of crabbed hew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That him full of melancholy did shew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bent hollow beetle browes, sharpe staring eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That mad or foolish seemd: one by his vew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mote deeme him borne with ill-disposed skyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When oblique Saturne sate in th’house of agonyes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whom Alma having shewed to her guestes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thence brought them to the second rowme, whose wals</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were painted faire with memorable gestes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of famous Wisards; and with picturals</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Magistrates, of courts, of tribunals,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of commen-wealthes, of states, of pollicy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of lawes, of judgementes, and of decretals,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All artes, all science, all Philosophy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all that in the world was ay thought wittily.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Of those that rowme was full; and them among</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There sate a man of ripe and perfect age,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who did them meditate all his life long,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That through continuall practise and usage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He now was growne right wise and wondrous sage:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Great pleasure had those straunger knightes to see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His goodly reason and grave personage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That his disciples both desyrd to bee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Alma thence them led to th’hindmost rowme of three.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>That chamber seemed ruinous and old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And therefore was removed far behind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet were the wals, that did the same uphold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Right firme and strong, though somwhat they declind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And therein sat an old old man, halfe blind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all decrepit in his feeble corse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet lively vigour rested in his mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And recompenst them with a better scorse:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Weake body wel is chang’d for minds redoubled forse.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This man of infinite remembraunce was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And things foregone through many ages held,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which he recorded still as they did pas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne suffred them to perish through long eld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As all things els the which this world doth weld;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But laid them up in his immortall scrine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where they for ever incorrupted dweld:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The warres he well remembred of king Nine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of old Assaracus, and Inachus divine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The yeares of Nestor nothing were to his,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne yet Mathusalem, though longest liv’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For he remembred both their infancis:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne wonder then, if that he were depriv’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of native strength now that he them surviv’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His chamber all was hangd about with rolls</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And old records from auncient times derivd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some made in books, some in long parchment scrolls,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That were all worm-eaten and full of canker holes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Amidst them all he in a chaire was sett,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tossing and turning them withouten end;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But for he was unhable them to fett,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A litle boy did on him still attend</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To reach, when ever he for ought did send;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And oft when thinges were lost, or laid amis,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That boy them sought and unto him did lend:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore he Anamnestes cleped is;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that old man Eumnestes, by their propertis.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The knightes there entring did him reverence dew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wondred at his endlesse exercise:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then as they gan his Library to vew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And antique Regesters for to avise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There chaunced to the Princes hand to rize</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An auncient booke, hight <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Briton Moniments</i>,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That of this lands first conquest did devize,</span>

					<span>The land which warlike Britons now possesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And therein have their mighty empire raysd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In antique times was salvage wildernesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unpeopled, unmannurd, unprovd, unpraysd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne was it Island then, ne was it paysd</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of merchants farre for profits therein praysd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But was all desolate, and of some thought</span>

					<span>By sea to have bene from the Celticke mayn-land brought.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Ne did it then deserve a name to have,</span>

					<span class="i1">Finding in it fit ports for fishers trade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gan more the same frequent, and further to invade.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But far in land a salvage nation dwelt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of hideous Giaunts, and halfe beastly men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That never tasted grace, nor goodnes felt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But wild like beastes lurking in loathsome den,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They held this land, and with their filthinesse</span>

					<span class="i1">Which that huge sonne of hideous Albion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose father Hercules in Fraunce did quell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Great Godmer threw, in fierce contention,</span>

					<span class="i1">Corineus had that Province utmost west</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To him assigned for his worthy lott,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which of his name and memorable gest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He called Cornwaile, yet so called best;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Debons shayre was that is Devonshyre:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Canute had his portion from the rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which he cald Canutium, for his hyre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now Cantium, which Kent we comenly inquyre.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus Brute this Realme unto his rule subdewd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And raigned long in great felicity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lov’d of his freends, and of his foes eschewd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He left three sonnes, his famous progeny,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Borne of fayre Inogene of Italy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mongst whom he parted his imperiall state,</span>

					<span class="i1">And Locrine left chiefe Lord of Britany.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At last ripe age bad him surrender late</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His life, and long good fortune, unto finall fate.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Locrine was left the soveraine Lord of all;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Albanact had all the Northerne part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which of himselfe Albania he did call;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Camber did possesse the Westerne quart,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Untill a nation straunge, with visage swart,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like Noyes great flood, with their importune sway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This land invaded with like violence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And did themselves through all the North display:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Untill that Locrine for his Realmes defence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did head against them make and strong munificence.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He them encountred, a confused rout,</span>

					<span class="i1">Foreby the River that whylome was hight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ancient Abus, where with courage stout</span>

					<span>Where he an end of batteill and of life did make.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The king retourned proud of victory,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And insolent wox through unwonted ease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That shortly he forgot the jeopardy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which in his land he lately did appease,</span>

					<span>From Guendolene his wife, though alwaies faithful prov’d.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The noble daughter of Corinëus</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would not endure to bee so vile disdaind,</span>

					<span class="i1">But, gathering force and corage valorous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Encountred him in batteill well ordaind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which him vanquisht she to fly constraind:</span>

					<span class="i1">But she so fast pursewd, that him she tooke</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Als his faire Leman flying through a brooke</span>

					<span>But both her selfe, and eke her daughter deare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Begotten by her kingly Paramoure,</span>

					<span class="i1">Adowne the rolling river she did poure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which of her name now Severne men do call:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such was the end that to disloyall love did fall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then for her sonne, which she to Locrin bore,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tho Madan raignd, unworthie of his race,</span>

					<span class="i1">For with all shame that sacred throne he fild.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Next Memprise, as unworthy of that place;</span>

				<p>

					<span class="i1">Right well recur’d, and did away that blame</span>

				<p>
					<span>His sonne, king Leill, by fathers labour long,</span>

					<span class="i1">Enjoy’d an heritage of lasting peace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And built Cairleill, and built Cairleon strong.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Next Huddibras his realme did not encrease,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Next him king Leyr in happie peace long raynd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But had no issue male him to succeed,</span>

					<span class="i1">But three faire daughters, which were well uptraind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In all that seemed fitt for kingly seed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mongst whom his realme he equally decreed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To have divided. Tho, when feeble age</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nigh to his utmost date he saw proceed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He cald his daughters, and with speeches sage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Inquyrd, which of them most did love her parentage?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The eldest, Gonorill, gan to protest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That she much more than her owne life him lov’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Regan greater love to him profest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then all the world, when ever it were proov’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Cordeill said she lov’d him as behoov’d:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose simple answere, wanting colours fayre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To paint it forth, him to displeasaunce moov’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in his crown he counted her no hayre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But twixt the other twain his kingdom whole did shayre.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So wedded th’one to Maglan king of Scottes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thother to the king of Cambria,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And twixt them shayrd his realme by equall lottes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But without dowre the wise Cordelia</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was sent to Aggannip of Celtica.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their aged Syre, thus eased of his crowne,</span>

					<span class="i1">A private life ledd in Albania</span>

					<span class="i1">With Gonorill, long had in great renowne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That nought him griev’d to beene from rule deposed downe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But true it is that, when the oyle is spent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The light goes out, and weeke is throwne away:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So, when he had resignd his regiment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His daughter gan despise his drouping day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wearie wax of his continuall stay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tho to his daughter Regan he repayrd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who him as first well used every way;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when of his departure she despayrd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her bountie she abated, and his cheare empayrd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The wretched man gan then avise too late,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That love is not where most it is profest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Too truely tryde in his extremest state.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At last, resolv’d likewise to prove the rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He to Cordelia him selfe addrest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who with entyre affection him receav’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As for her Syre and king her seemed best;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And after all an army strong she leav’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To war on those which him had of his realme bereav’d,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So to his crowne she him restord againe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which he dyde, made ripe for death by eld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And after wild it should to her remaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who peaceably the same long time did weld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all mens harts in dew obedience held;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till that her sisters children, woxen strong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through proud ambition against her rebeld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And overcommen kept in prison long,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till weary of that wretched life her selfe she hong.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then gan the bloody brethren both to raine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But fierce Cundah gan shortly to envy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His brother Morgan, prickt with proud disdaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To have a pere in part of soverainty;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And kindling coles of cruell enmity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Raisd warre, and him in batteill overthrew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence as he to those woody hilles did fly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which hight of him Glamorgan, there him slew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then did he raigne alone, when he none equall knew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His sonne Rivall’his dead rowme did supply;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In whose sad time blood did from heaven rayne.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Next great Gurgustus, then faire Cæcily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In constant peace their kingdomes did contayne.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After whom Lago, and Kinmarke did rayne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Gorbogud, till far in years he grew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then his ambitious sonnes unto them twayne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Arraught the rule, and from their father drew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stout Ferrex and sterne Porrex him in prison threw.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But O! the greedy thirst of royall crowne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That knowes no kinred, nor regardes no right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stird Porrex up to put his brother downe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, unto him assembling forreigne might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made warre on him, and fell him selfe in fight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose death t’avenge, his mother mercilesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Most mercilesse of women, Wyden hight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her other sonne fast sleeping did oppresse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with most cruell hand him murdred pittilesse.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Here ended Brutus sacred progeny,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which had seven hundred yeares this scepter borne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With high renowme and great felicity:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The noble braunch from th’antique stocke was torne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through discord, and the roiall throne forlorne.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thenceforth this Realme was into factions rent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whilest each of Brutus boasted to be borne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in the end was left no moniment</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Brutus, nor of Britons glorie auncient.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then up arose a man of matchlesse might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wondrous wit to menage high affayres,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, stird with pitty of the stressed plight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of this sad realme, cut into sondry shayres</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By such as claymd themselves Brutes rightfull hayres,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gathered the Princes of the people loose</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To taken counsell of their common cares;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, with his wisedom won, him streight did choose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their king, and swore him fealty to win or loose.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then made he head against his enimies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Ymner slew of Logris miscreate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then Ruddoc and proud Stater, both allyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This of Albany newly nominate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that of Cambry king confirmed late,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose countries he redus’d to quiet state,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Now one, which earst were many made through variaunce.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then made he sacred lawes, which some men say</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were unto him reveald in vision;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By which he freed the Traveilers high-way,</span>

					<span class="i1">The Churches part, and Ploughmans portion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Restraining stealth and strong extortion,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Donwallo dyde, (for what may live for ay?)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And left two sonnes, of pearelesse prowesse both,</span>

					<span class="i1">The recompence of their perjured oth;</span>

					<span class="i1">And cruell rancour dim’d his valorous</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And mightie deedes, should matched have the best:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As well in that same field victorious</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against the forreine Morands he exprest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet lives his memorie, though carcas sleepe in rest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Five sonnes he left, begotten of one wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All which successively by turnes did rayne:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">First Gorboman, a man of vertuous life;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Next Archigald, who for his proud disdayne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Deposed was from princedome soverayne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And pitteous Elidure put in his sted;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who shortly it to him restord agayne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till by his death he it recovered:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Peridure and Vigent him disthronized.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In wretched prison long he did remaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till they outraigned had their utmost date,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then therein reseized was againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ruled long with honorable state,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till he surrendered Realme and life to fate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then all the sonnes of these five brethren raynd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By dew successe, and all their Nephewes late;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even thrise eleven descents the crowne retaynd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till aged Hely by dew heritage it gaynd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He had two sonnes, whose eldest, called Lud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Left of his life most famous memory,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And endlesse moniments of his great good:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ruin’d wals he did reædifye</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Troynovant, gainst force of enimy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And built that gate which of his name is hight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By which he lyes entombed solemnly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He left two sonnes, too young to rule aright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Androgeus and Tenantius, pictures of his might.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whilst they were young, Cassibalane, their Eme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was by the people chosen in their sted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who on him tooke the roiall Diademe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And goodly well long time it governed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till the prowde Romanes him disquieted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And warlike Cæsar, tempted with the name</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of this sweet Island never conquered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And envying the Britons blazed fame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(O hideous hunger of dominion!) hither came.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet twise they were repulsed backe againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And twise renforst backe to their ships to fly;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whiles with blood they all the shore did staine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the gray Ocean into purple dy:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne had they footing found at last, perdie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had not Androgeus, false to native soyle,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Nought els but treason from the first this land did foyle.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So by him Cæsar got the victory,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through great bloodshed and many a sad assay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which himselfe was charged heavily</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of hardy Nennius, whom he yet did slay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But lost his sword, yet to be seene this day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thenceforth this land was tributarie made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">T’ambitious Rome, and did their rule obay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till Arthur all that reckoning defrayd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet oft the Briton kings against them strongly swayd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Next him Tenantius raignd; them Kimbeline,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What time th’eternall Lord in fleshly slime</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Enwombed was, from wretched Adams line</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To purge away the guilt of sinfull crime.</span>

					<span class="i1">(O too high ditty for my simple rime!)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Soone after this the Romanes him warrayd;</span>

					<span>For that their tribute he refusd to let be payd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Good Claudius, that next was Emperour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An army brought, and with him batteile fought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which the king was by a Treachetour</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Disguised slaine, ere any thereof thought:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet ceased not the bloody fight for ought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For Arvirage his brothers place supplyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both in his armes and crowne, and by that draught</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did drive the Romanes to the weaker syde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That they to peace agreed. So all was pacifyde.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Was never king more highly magnifide,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For which the Emperour to him allide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His daughter Genuiss’ in marriage:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet shortly he renounst the vassallage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Rome againe, who hither hastly sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vespasian, that with great spoile and rage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forwasted all, till Genuissa gent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Persuaded him to ceasse, and her lord to relent.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He dide; and him succeeded Marius,</span>

					<span class="i1">The sacred pledge of Christes Evangely.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet true it is, that long before that day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hither came Joseph of Arimathy,</span>

					<span>And preacht the truth; but since it greatly did decay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This good king shortly without issew dide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereof great trouble in the kingdome grew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That did her selfe in sondry parts divide,</span>

					<span class="i1">Which seeing, stout Bunduca up arose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And taking armes the Britons to her drew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With whom she marched streight against her foes,</span>

					<span>And them unwares besides the Severne did enclose.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There she with them a cruell batteill tryde,</span>

					<span class="i1">Not with so good successe as shee deserv’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By reason that the Captaines on her syde,</span>

					<span class="i1">Yet, such as were through former flight preserv’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gathering againe, her Host she did renew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with fresh corage on the victor servd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But being all defeated, save a few,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rather then fly, or be captiv’d, her selfe she slew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O famous moniment of womens prayse!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Matchable either to Semiramis,</span>

					<span>Shee triumphed on death, in enemies despight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Her reliques Fulgent having gathered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fought with Severus, and him overthrew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet in the chace was slaine of them that fled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So made them victors whome he did subdew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then gan Carausius tirannize anew,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without or robe or rag to hide his shame:</span>

					<span class="i1">Then afterwards he in his stead did raigne,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when the Romanes heard, they hither sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Constantius, a man of mickle might,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Of whom he did great Constantine begett,</span>

					<span class="i1">Slaying Traherne, and having overcome</span>
					<br/>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But wanting yssew male, his daughter deare</span>

				<p>
					<span>Who having oft in batteill vanquished</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those spoylefull Picts, and swarming Easterlings,</span>

					<span class="i1">Long time in peace his realme established,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of neighbour Scots, and forrein Scatterlings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which the world did in those dayes abound:</span>

					<span class="i1">Which to outbarre, with painefull pyonings</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From sea to sea he heapt a mighty mound,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Three sones he dying left, all under age;</span>

					<span class="i1">Usurpt the crowne during their pupillage;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which th’Infants tutors gathering to feare,</span>

					<span class="i1">Them closely into Armorick did beare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For dread of whom, and for those Picts annoyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He sent to Germany straunge aid to reare;</span>

					<span class="i1">From whence eftsoones arrived here three hoyes</span>

					<span>Of Saxons, whom he for his safety imployes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Two brethren were their Capitayns, which hight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hengist and Horsus, well approv’d in warre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And both of them men of renowmed might;</span>

					<span class="i1">Who making vantage of their civile jarre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of those forreyners which came from farre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Grew great, and got large portions of land,</span>

					<span class="i1">That in the Realme ere long they stronger arre</span>

					<span>And Vortiger have forst the kingdome to aband.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But by the helpe of Vortimere his sonne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He is againe unto his rule restord;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Hengist, seeming sad for that was donne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Received is to grace and new accord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through his faire daughters face and flattring word.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Soone after which three hundred Lords he slew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of British blood, all sitting at his bord;</span>

					<span>Th’eternall marks of treason may at Stonheng vew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>By this the sonnes of Constantine, which fled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ambrose and Uther, did ripe yeares attayne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, here arriving, strongly challenged</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The crowne which Vortiger did long detayne:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, flying from his guilt, by them was slayne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Hengist eke soon brought to shamefull death.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thenceforth Aurelius peaceably did rayne,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>After him Uther, which Pendragon hight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Succeeding⁠—There abruptly it did end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without full point, or other Cesure right;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if the rest some wicked hand did rend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or th’Author selfe could not at least attend</span>

					<span class="i1">To finish it: that so untimely breach</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Prince him selfe halfe seemed to offend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet secret pleasure did offence empeach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wonder of antiquity long stopt his speach.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At last, quite ravisht with delight to heare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The royall Ofspring of his native land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cryde out; “Deare countrey! O! how dearely deare</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A man, of many parts from beasts deryv’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then stole fire from heven to animate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His worke, for which he was by Jove depryv’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of life him self, and hartstrings of an Aegle ryv’d.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>That man so made he called Elfe, to weet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Quick, the first author of all Elfin kynd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, wandring through the world with wearie feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did in the gardins of Adonis fynd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A goodly creature, whom he deemd in mynd</span>

					<span class="i1">To be no earthly wight, but either Spright,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore a Fay he her according hight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of whom all Faeryes spring, and fetch their lignage right.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Of these a mighty people shortly grew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And puissant kinges which all the world warrayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to them selves all Nations did subdew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The first and eldest, which that scepter swayd,</span>

					<span class="i1">Was Elfin; him all India obayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all that now America men call:</span>

					<span>But Elfiline enclosd it with a golden wall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His sonne was Elfinell, who overcame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The wicked Gobbelines in bloody field;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Elfant was of most renowmed fame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who all of Christall did Panthea build:</span>

					<span class="i1">Then Elfinor, who was in magick skild;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He built by art upon the glassy See</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A bridge of bras, whose sound hevens thunder seem’d to bee.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He left three sonnes, the which in order raynd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all their Ofspring, in their dew descents;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even seven hundred Princes, which maintaynd</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with rich spoyles and famous victorie</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did high advaunce the crowne of Faery:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He left two sonnes, of which faire Elferon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The eldest brother, did untimely dy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose emptie place the mightie Oberon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Doubly supplide, in spousall and dominion.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Great was his power and glorie over all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which, him before, that sacred seate did fill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That yet remaines his wide memoriall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He dying left the fairest Tanaquill,</span>

					<span class="i1">Fairer and nobler liveth none this howre,</span>

					<span class="i1">With him the Palmer eke in habit sad</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>So to the rivers syde they both together far’d:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Where them awaited ready at the ford</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Ferriman, as Alma had behight,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For all so soone as Guyon thence was gon</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon his voyage with his trustie guyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That wicked band of villeins fresh begon</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That castle to assaile on every side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And lay strong siege about it far and wyde.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So huge and infinite their numbers were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all the land they under them did hyde;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So fowle and ugly, that exceeding feare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their visages imprest when they approched neare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Them in twelve troupes their Captein did dispart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And round about in fittest steades did place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where each might best offend his proper part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And his contrary object most deface,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As every one seem’d meetest in that cace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seven of the same against the Castle gate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In strong entrenchments he did closely place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which with incessaunt force and endlesse hate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They battred day and night, and entraunce did awate.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The other five five sondry wayes he sett</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against the five great Bulwarkes of that pyle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And unto each a Bulwarke did arrett,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">T’assayle with open force or hidden guyle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In hope thereof to win victorious spoile.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They all that charge did fervently apply</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With greedie malice and importune toyle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And planted there their huge artillery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With which they dayly made most dreadfull battery.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The first troupe was a monstrous rablement</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of fowle misshapen wightes, of which some were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Headed like Owles, with beckes uncomely bent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Others like Dogs; others like Gryphons dreare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And some had wings, and some had clawes to teare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And every one of them had Lynces eyes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And every one did bow and arrowes beare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All those were lawlesse lustes, currupt envyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And covetous aspects, all cruell enimyes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Those same against the bulwarke of the Sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did lay strong siege and battailous assault,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne once did yield it respitt day nor night;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But soone as Titan gan his head exault,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And soone againe as he his light withhault,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their wicked engins they against it bent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That is, each thing by which the eyes may fault:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But two then all more huge and violent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beautie and Money, they that Bulwarke sorely rent.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The second Bulwarke was the Hearing sence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gainst which the second troupe assignment makes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Deformed creatures, in straunge difference,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some having heads like Harts, some like to Snakes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some like wilde Bores late rouzd out of the brakes:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Slaunderous reproches, and fowle infamies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Leasinges, backbytinges, and vainglorious crakes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bad counsels, prayses, and false flatteries:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All those against that fort did bend their batteries.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Likewise that same third Fort, that is the Smell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that third troupe was cruelly assayd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose hideous shapes were like to feendes of hell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some like to houndes, some like to Apes, dismayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some like to Puttockes, all in plumes arayd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All shap’t according their conditions:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For by those ugly formes weren pourtrayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Foolish delights, and fond abusions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which doe that sence besiege with light illusions.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And that fourth band which cruell battry bent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against the fourth Bulwarke, that is the Taste,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was, as the rest, a grysie rablement;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some mouth’d like greedy Oystriges; some faste</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like loathly Toades; some fashioned in the waste</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like swine: for so deformd is luxury,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Surfeat, misdiet, and unthriftie waste,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vaine feastes, and ydle superfluity:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All those this sences Fort assayle incessantly.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But the fift troupe, most horrible of hew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ferce of force, is dreadfull to report;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For some like Snailes, some did like spyders shew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And some like ugly Urchins thick and short:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cruelly they assayed that fift Fort,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Armed with dartes of sensuall Delight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With stinges of carnall lust, and strong effort</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of feeling pleasures, with which day and night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against that same fift bulwarke they continued fight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus these twelve troupes with dreadfull puissaunce</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against that Castle restlesse siege did lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And evermore their hideous Ordinaunce</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the Bulwarkes cruelly did play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That now it gan to threaten neare decay:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And evermore their wicked Capitayn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Provoked them the breaches to assay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sometimes with threats, sometimes with hope of gayn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which by the ransack of that peece they should attayn.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>On th’other syde, th’assieged Castles ward</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their stedfast stonds did mightily maintaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And many bold repulse and many hard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Achievement wrought, with perill and with payne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That goodly frame from ruine to sustaine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And those two brethren Gyauntes did defend</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The walles so stoutly with their sturdie mayne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That never entraunce any durst pretend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But they to direfull death their groning ghosts did send.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The noble Virgin, Ladie of the Place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was much dismayed with that dreadful sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For never was she in so evill cace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till that the Prince, seeing her wofull plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gan her recomfort from so sad affright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Offring his service, and his dearest life</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For her defence against that Carle to fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which was their chiefe and th’authour of that strife:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She him remercied as the Patrone of her life.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Eftsoones himselfe in glitterand armes he dight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And his well proved weapons to him hent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So, taking courteous congé, he behight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those gates to be unbar’d, and forth he went.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fayre mote he thee, the prowest and most gent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ever brandished bright steele on hye!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whome soone as that unruly rablement</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With his gay Squyre issewing did espye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They reard a most outrageous dreadfull yelling cry:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And therewithall attonce at him let fly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their fluttring arrowes, thicke as flakes of snow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And round about him flocke impetuously,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like a great water flood, that tombling low</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fom the high mountaines, threates to overflow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With suddein fury all the fertile playne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the sad husbandmans long hope doth throw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Adowne the streame, and all his vowes make vayne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor bounds nor banks his headlong ruine may sustayne.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Upon his shield their heaped hayle he bore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with his sword disperst the raskall flockes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which fled asonder, and him fell before;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As withered leaves drop from their dryed stockes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When the wroth Western wind does reave their locks:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And underneath him his courageous steed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The fierce Spumador, trode them downe like docks;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The fierce Spumador, borne of heavenly seed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such as Laomedon of Phœbus race did breed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which suddeine horrour and confused cry</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When as their Capteine heard, in haste he yode</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The cause to weet, and fault to remedy:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon a Tygre swift and fierce he rode,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That as the winde ran underneath his lode,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whiles his long legs nigh raught unto the ground.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full large he was of limbe, and shoulders brode,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But of such subtile substance and unsound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That like a ghost he seem’d whose grave-clothes were unbound:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And in his hand a bended bow was seene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And many arrowes under his right side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All deadly daungerous, all cruell keene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Headed with flint, and fethers bloody dide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such as the Indians in their quivers hide:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those could he well direct and streight as line,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And bid them strike the marke which he had eyde;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne was there salve, ne was there medicine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That mote recure their wounds; so inly they did tine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As pale and wan as ashes was his looke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His body leane and meagre as a rake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And skin all withered like a dryed rooke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereto as cold and drery as a snake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That seemd to tremble evermore and quake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All in a canvas thin he was bedight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And girded with a belt of twisted brake:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon his head he wore an Helmet light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Made of a dead mans skull, that seemd a ghastly sight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Maleger was his name; and after him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There follow’d fast at hand two wicked Hags,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With hoary lockes all loose, and visage grim;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their feet unshod, their bodies wrapt in rags,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And both as swift on foot as chased Stags;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And yet the one her other legge had lame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which with a staffe, all full of litle snags,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She did support, and Impotence her name:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But th’other was Impatience, arm’d with raging flame.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Soone as the Carle from far the Prince espyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Glistring in armes and warlike ornament,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His Beast he felly prickt on either syde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And his mischievous bow full readie bent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which at him a cruell shaft he sent:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he was warie, and it warded well</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon his shield, that it no further went,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But to the ground the idle quarrell fell:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he another and another did expell.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which to prevent the Prince his mortall speare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Soone to him raught, and fierce at him did ride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be avenged of that shot whyleare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he was not so hardy to abide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That bitter stownd, but turning quicke aside</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His light-foot beast, fled fast away for feare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom to poursue the Infant after hide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So fast as his good Courser could him beare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But labour lost it was to weene approch him neare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For as the winged wind his Tigre fled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That vew of eye could scarse him overtake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne scarse his feet on ground were seene to tred:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through hils and dales he speedy way did make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne hedge ne ditch his readie passage brake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in his flight the villein turn’d his face</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(As wonts the Tartar by the Caspian lake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whenas the Russian him in fight does chace)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto his Tygres taile, and shot at him apace.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Apace he shot, and yet he fled apace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still as the greedy knight nigh to him drew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And oftentimes he would relent his pace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That him his foe more fiercely should poursew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when his uncouth manner he did vew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He gan avize to follow him no more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But keepe his standing, and his shaftes eschew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Untill he quite had spent his perlous store,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then assayle him fresh, ere he could shift for more.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But that lame Hag, still as abroad he strew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His wicked arrowes, gathered them againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to him brought, fresh batteill to renew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which he espying cast her to restraine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From yielding succour to that cursed Swaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And her attaching thought her hands to tye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But soone as him dismounted on the plaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That other Hag did far away espye</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Binding her sister, she to him ran hastily;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And catching hold of him, as downe he lent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him backeward overthrew, and downe him stayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With their rude handes and gryesly graplement;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till that the villein, comming to their ayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon him fell, and lode upon him layd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full litle wanted but he had him slaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of the battell balefull end had made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had not his gentle Squire beheld his paine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And commen to his reskew, ere his bitter bane.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So greatest and most glorious thing on ground</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">May often need the helpe of weaker hand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So feeble is mans state, and life unsound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in assuraunce it may never stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till it dissolved be from earthly band.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Proofe be thou, Prince, the prowest man alyve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And noblest borne of all in Britayne land;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet thee fierce Fortune did so nearely drive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, had not grace thee blest, thou shouldest not survive.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Squyre arriving fiercely in his armes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Snatcht first the one, and then the other Jade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His chiefest letts and authors of his harmes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And them perforce withheld with threatned blade,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whiles the Prince, prickt with reprochful shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As one awakte out of long slombring shade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Revivyng thought of glory and of fame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>United all his powres to purge him selfe from blame.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like as a fire, the which in hollow cave</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hath long bene underkept and down supprest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With murmurous disdayne doth inly rave,</span>

					<span class="i1">At last breakes forth with furious unrest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And strives to mount unto his native seat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All that did earst it hinder and molest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yt now devoures with flames and scorching heat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And carries into smoake with rage and horror great.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So mightely the Briton Prince him rouzd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of his holde, and broke his caytive bands;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And as a Beare, whom angry curres have touzd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Having off-shakt them and escapt their hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Becomes more fell, and all that him withstands</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Treads down and overthrowes. Now had the Carle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Alighted from his Tigre, and his hands</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Discharged of his bow and deadly quar’le,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To seize upon his foe flatt lying on the marle.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which now him turnd to disavantage deare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For neither can he fly, nor other harme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But trust unto his strength and manhood meare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sith now he is far from his monstrous swarme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of his weapons did himselfe disarme.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The knight, yet wrothfull for his late disgrace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fiercely advaunst his valorous right arme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And him so sore smott with his yron mace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That groveling to the ground he fell, and fild his place.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Wel weened hee that field was then his owne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all his labor brought to happy end;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When suddein up the villeine overthrowne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of his swowne arose, fresh to contend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gan him selfe to second battaill bend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As hurt he had not beene. Thereby there lay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An huge great stone, which stood upon one end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And had not bene removed many a day;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some land-marke seemd to bee, or signe of sundry way:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The same he snatcht, and with exceeding sway</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Threw at his foe, who was right well aware</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To shonne the engin of his meant decay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It booted not to thinke that throw to beare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But grownd he gave, and lightly lept areare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eft fierce retourning, as a faulcon fayre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That once hath failed of her souse full neare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Remounts againe into the open ayre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And unto better fortune doth her selfe prepayre.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So brave retourning, with his brandisht blade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He to the Carle him selfe agayn addrest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And strooke at him so sternely, that he made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An open passage through his riven brest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That halfe the steele behind his backe did rest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which drawing backe, he looked evermore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When the hart blood should gush out of his chest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or his dead corse should fall upon the flore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But his dead corse upon the flore fell nathemore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ne drop of blood appeared shed to bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All were the wownd so wide and wonderous</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That through his carcas one might playnly see.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Halfe in amaze with horror hideous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And halfe in rage to be deluded thus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Again through both the sides he strooke him quight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That made his spright to grone full piteous;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet nathemore forth fled his groning spright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But freshly, as at first, prepard himselfe to fight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thereat he smitten was with great affright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And trembling terror did his hart apall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne wist he what to thinke of that same sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne what to say, ne what to doe at all:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He doubted least it were some magicall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Illusion that did beguile his sense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or wandring ghost that wanted funerall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or aery spirite under false pretence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or hellish feend raysd up through divelish science.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His wonder far exceeded reasons reach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he began to doubt his dazeled sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And oft of error did himselfe appeach:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Flesh without blood, a person without spright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wounds without hurt, a body without might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That could doe harme, yet could not harmed bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That could not die, yet seemd a mortall wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That was most strong in most infirmitee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like did he never heare, like did he never see.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Awhile he stood in this astonishment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet would he not for all his great dismay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Give over to effect his first intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And th’utmost meanes of victory assay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or th’utmost yssew of his owne decay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His owne good sword Mordure, that never fayld</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At need till now, he lightly threw away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And his bright shield that nought him now avayld;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with his naked hands him forcibly assayld.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Twixt his two mighty armes him up he snatcht,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And crusht his carcas so against his brest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the disdainfull sowle he thence dispatcht,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And th’ydle breath all utterly exprest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tho, when he felt him dead, adowne he kest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The lumpish corse unto the sencelesse grownd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Adowne he kest it with so puissant wrest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That backe againe it did alofte rebownd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gave against his mother earth a gronefull sownd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As when Joves harnesse-bearing Bird from hye</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stoupes at a flying heron with proud disdayne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The stone-dead quarrey falls so forciblye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That yt rebownds against the lowly playne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A second fall redoubling backe agayne.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then thought the Prince all peril sure was past,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that he victor onely did remayne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No sooner thought, then that the Carle as fast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gan heap huge strokes on him, as ere he down was cast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nigh his wits end then woxe th’amazed knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thought his labor lost, and travell vayne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against this lifelesse shadow so to fight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet life he saw, and felt his mighty mayne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, whiles he marveild still, did still him payne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forthy he gan some other wayes advize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How to take life from that dead-living swayne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom still he marked freshly to arize</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From th’earth, and from her womb new spirits to reprize.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He then remembred well, that had bene sayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How th’Earth his mother was, and first him bore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She eke, so often as his life decayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did life with usury to him restore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And reysd him up much stronger then before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So soone as he unto her wombe did fall:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore to grownd he would him cast no more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne him committ to grave terrestriall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But beare him farre from hope of succour usuall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tho up he caught him twixt his puissant hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And having scruzd out of his carrion corse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The lothfull life, now loosd from sinfull bands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon his shoulders carried him perforse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above three furlongs, taking his full course</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until he came unto a standing lake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him thereinto he threw without remorse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne stird, till hope of life did him forsake:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So end of that Carles dayes and his owne paynes did make.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when those wicked Hags from far did spye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like two mad dogs they ran about the lands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And th’one of them with dreadfull yelling crye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Throwing away her broken chaines and bands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And having quencht her burning fier-brands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hedlong her selfe did cast into that lake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Impotence with her owne wilfull hands</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One of Malegers cursed darts did take,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So ryv’d her trembling hart, and wicked end did make.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus now alone he conquerour remaines:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tho, cumming to his Squyre that kept his steed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thought to have mounted; but his feeble vaines</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him faild thereto, and served not his need,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through losse of blood which from his wounds did bleed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he began to faint, and life decay:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But his good Squyre, him helping up with speed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With stedfast hand upon his horse did stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And led him to the Castle by the beaten way.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Where many Groomes and Squyres ready were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To take him from his steed full tenderly;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke the fayrest Alma mett him there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With balme, and wine, and costly spicery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To comfort him in his infirmity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eftesoones shee causd him up to be convayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of his armes despoyled easily</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In sumptuous bed shee made him to be layd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And al the while his wounds were dressing by him stayd.</span>

					<span class="i1">Where Pleasure dwelles in sensuall delights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mongst thousand dangers, and ten thousand Magick mights.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Two dayes now in that sea he sayled has,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ever land beheld, ne living wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ought save perill still as he did pas:</span>

					<span class="i1">Tho, when appeared the third Morrow bright</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the waves to spred her trembling light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An hideous roring far away they heard,</span>

					<span class="i1">That all their sences filled with affright;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And streight they saw the raging surges reard</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up to the skyes, that them of drowning made affeard.</span>
				</p>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And belcheth forth his superfluity,</span>

					<span>They on this rock are rent, and sunck in helples wawes.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Forward they passe, and strongly he them rowes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Untill they nigh unto that Gulfe arryve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where streame more violent and greedy growes:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then he with all his puisaunce doth stryve</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To strike his oares, and mightily doth drive</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The hollow vessell through the threatfull wave;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which, gaping wide to swallow them alyve</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In th’huge abysse of his engulfing grave,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>On thother side they saw that perilous Rocke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Threatning it selfe on them to ruinate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On whose sharp cliftes the ribs of vessels broke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And shivered ships, which had beene wrecked late,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet stuck with carkases exanimate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of such, as having all their substance spent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In wanton joyes and lustes intemperate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did afterwards make shipwrack violent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both of their life and fame, for ever fowly blent.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Forthy this hight The Rocke of vile Reproch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A daungerous and detestable place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which nor fish nor fowle did once approch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But yelling Meawes, with Seagulles hoars and bace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Cormoyraunts, with birds of ravenous race,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which still sat waiting on that wastfull clift</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For spoile of wretches, whose unhappy cace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After lost credit and consumed thrift,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At last them driven hath to this despairefull drift.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Palmer, seeing them in safetie past,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus saide; “Behold th’ensamples in our sights</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of lustfull luxurie and thriftlesse wast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What now is left of miserable wightes,</span>

					<span class="i1">Which spent their looser daies in leud delightes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But shame and sad reproch, here to be red</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By these rent reliques, speaking their ill plightes?</span>

				<p>
					<span>So forth they rowed; and that Ferryman</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With his stiffe oares did brush the sea so strong,</span>

				<p>
					<span>“That may not bee,” said then the Ferryman,</span>

					<span class="i1">“Least wee unweeting hap to be fordonne;</span>

				<p>
					<span>That was the wanton Phædria, which late</span>

					<span class="i1">But by the checked wave they did descry</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It plaine, and by the sea discoloured:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It called was the quickesand of Unthriftyhed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They, passing by, a goodly Ship did see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Laden from far with precious merchandize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And bravely furnished as ship might bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which through great disaventure, or mesprize,</span>

				<p>
					<span>On th’other side they see that perilous Poole,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did covet, as they passed by that way,</span>

					<span>Of his wide Labyrinth, and then to have them dround.</span>
				</p>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Huge Ziffius, whom Mariners eschew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No lesse then rockes, (as travellers informe)</span>

				<p>
					<span>All these, and thousand thousands many more,</span>

					<span class="i1">And more deformed Monsters thousand fold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With dreadfull noise and hollow rombling rore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came rushing, in the fomy waves enrold,</span>

					<span class="i1">Which seem’d to fly for feare them to behold.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne wonder, if these did the knight appall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For all that here on earth we dreadfull hold,</span>

					<span class="i1">Tho lifting up his vertuous staffe on hye,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Quit from that danger forth their course they kept;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And as they went they heard a ruefull cry</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of one that wayld and pittifully wept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That through the sea resounding plaints did fly:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At last they in an Island did espy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A seemely Maiden sitting by the shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with great sorrow and sad agony</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seemed some great misfortune to deplore,</span>

					<span>And lowd to them for succour called evermore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which Guyon hearing streight his Palmer bad</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To stere the bote towards that dolefull Mayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he might know and ease her sorrow sad;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, him avizing better, to him sayd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Faire Sir, be not displeasd if disobayd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For ill it were to hearken to her cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For she is inly nothing ill apayd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But onely womanish fine forgery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your stubborne hart t’affect with fraile infirmity.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“To which when she your courage hath inclind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through foolish pitty, then her guilefull bayt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She will embosome deeper in your mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And for your ruine at the last awayt.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Knight was ruled, and the Boteman strayt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Held on his course with stayed stedfastnesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ever shroncke, ne ever sought to bayt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His tyred armes for toylesome wearinesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But with his oares did sweepe the watry wildernesse.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And now they nigh approched to the sted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereas those Mermayds dwelt: it was a still</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And calmy bay, on th’one side sheltered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the brode shadow of an hoarie hill;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On th’other side an high rocke toured still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That twixt them both a pleasaunt port they made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And did like an halfe Theatre fulfill:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There those five sisters had continuall trade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And usd to bath themselves in that deceiptfull shade.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They were faire Ladies, till they fondly striv’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With th’Heliconian maides for maystery;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of whom they, overcomen, were depriv’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of their proud beautie, and th’one moyity</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Transformd to fish for their bold surquedry;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But th’upper halfe their hew retayned still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And their sweet skill in wonted melody;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which ever after they abusd to ill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>T’allure weake traveillers, whom gotten they did kill.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So now to Guyon, as he passed by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their pleasaunt tunes they sweetly thus applyde:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“O thou fayre sonne of gentle Faery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That art in mightie armes most magnifyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above all knights that ever batteill tryde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O! turne thy rudder hitherward awhile:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here may thy storme-bett vessell safely ryde;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This is the Port of rest from troublous toyle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The worldes sweet In from paine and wearisome turmoyle.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that the rolling sea, resounding soft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In his big base them fitly answered;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on the rocke the waves breaking aloft</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A solemne Meane unto them measured;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whiles sweet Zephyrus lowd whisteled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His treble, a straunge kinde of harmony,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which Guyons senses softly tickeled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he the boteman bad row easily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And let him heare some part of their rare melody.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But him the Palmer from that vanity</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With temperate advice discounselled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That they it past, and shortly gan descry</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The land to which their course they leveled;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When suddeinly a grosse fog overspred</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With his dull vapour all that desert has,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And heavens chearefull face enveloped,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all things one, and one as nothing was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this great Universe seemd one confused mas.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thereat they greatly were dismayd, ne wist</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How to direct theyr way in darkenes wide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But feard to wander in that wastefull mist,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For tombling into mischiefe unespide:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Worse is the daunger hidden then descride.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Suddeinly an innumerable flight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of harmefull fowles about them fluttering cride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with their wicked wings them ofte did smight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sore annoyed, groping in that griesly night.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Even all the nation of unfortunate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fatall birds about them flocked were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such as by nature men abhorre and hate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ill-faste Owle, deaths dreadfull messengere;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The hoars Night-raven, trump of dolefull drere;</span>

					<span class="i1">The lether-winged Batt, dayes enimy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ruefull Strich, still waiting on the bere;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whistler shrill, that whoso heares doth dy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hellish Harpyes, prophets of sad destiny.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All those, and all that els does horror breed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">About them flew, and fild their sayles with feare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet stayd they not, but forward did proceed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whiles th’one did row, and th’other stifly steare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till that at last the weather gan to cleare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the faire land it selfe did playnly sheow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said then the Palmer; “Lo! where does appeare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sacred soile where all our perills grow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therfore, Sir knight, your ready arms about you throw.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He hearkned, and his armes about him tooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whiles the nimble bote so well her sped,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with her crooked keele the land she strooke:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then forth the noble Guyon sallied,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And his sage Palmer that him governed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But th’other by his bote behind did stay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They marched fayrly forth, of nought ydred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both firmely armd for every hard assay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With constancy and care, gainst daunger and dismay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ere long they heard an hideous bellowing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of many beasts, that roard outrageously,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if that hungers poynt or Venus sting</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had them enraged with fell surquedry:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet nought they feard, but past on hardily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Untill they came in vew of those wilde beasts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who all attonce, gaping full greedily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And rearing fercely their upstaring crests,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ran towards to devoure those unexpected guests.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But soone as they approcht with deadly threat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Palmer over them his staffe upheld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His mighty staffe, that could all charmes defeat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eftesoones their stubborne corages were queld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And high advaunced crests downe meekely feld;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Instead of fraying, they them selves did feare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And trembled as them passing they beheld:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such wondrous powre did in that staffe appeare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All monsters to subdew to him that did it beare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Of that same wood it fram’d was cunningly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which Caduceus whilome was made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Caduceus, the rod of Mercury,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which he wonts the Stygian realmes invade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through ghastly horror and eternall shade:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Th’infernall feends with it he can asswage,</span>
					<br/>

					<span class="i1">And rule the Furyes when they most doe rage.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such vertue in his staffe had eke this Palmer sage.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thence passing forth, they shortly doe arryve</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereas the Bowre of Blisse was situate;</span>

					<span class="i1">A place pickt out by choyce of best alyve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That natures worke by art can imitate:</span>

					<span class="i1">In which whatever in this worldly state</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is sweete and pleasing unto living sense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or that may dayntest fantasy aggrate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was poured forth with plentifull dispence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And made there to abound with lavish affluence.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Goodly it was enclosed rownd about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As well their entred guestes to keep within,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As those unruly beasts to hold without;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet was the fence thereof but weake and thin:</span>

					<span>Rather for pleasure then for battery or fight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yt framed was of precious yvory,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That seemd a worke of admirable witt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And therein all the famous history</span>

					<span class="i1">The wondred Argo, which in venturous peece</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ye might have seene the frothy billowes fry</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And otherwhere the snowy substaunce sprent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With vermell, like the boyes blood therein shed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A piteous spectacle did represent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And otherwhiles, with gold besprinkeled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yt seemd thenchaunted flame which did Crëusa wed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All this and more might in that goodly gate</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which thither came; but in the Porch there sate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A comely personage of stature tall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And semblaunce pleasing, more then naturall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That traveilers to him seemd to entize:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His looser garment to the ground did fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And flew about his heeles in wanton wize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not fitt for speedy pace, or manly exercize.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They in that place him Genius did call:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not that celestiall powre, to whom the care</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of life, and generation of all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That lives, perteines in charge particulare,</span>

					<span class="i1">Who wondrous things concerning our welfare,</span>

					<span class="i1">That is our Selfe, whom though we do not see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet each doth in him selfe it well perceive to bee.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Therefore a God him sage Antiquity</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did wisely make, and good Agdistes call;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But this same was to that quite contrary,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The foe of life, that good envyes to all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That secretly doth us procure to fall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through guilefull semblants which he makes us see:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He of this Gardin had the governall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Pleasures porter was devizd to bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Holding a staffe in hand for mere formalitee.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With diverse flowres he daintily was deckt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And strowed rownd about; and by his side</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A mighty Mazer bowle of wine was sett,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if it had to him bene sacrifide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherewith all newcome guests he gratyfide:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So did he eke Sir Guyon passing by;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he his ydle curtesie defide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And overthrew his bowle disdainfully,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And broke his staffe with which he charmed semblants sly.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus being entred, they behold arownd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A large and spacious plaine, on every side</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Strowed with pleasauns; whose fayre grassy grownd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mantled with greene, and goodly beautifide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With all the ornaments of Floraes pride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherewith her mother Art, as halfe in scorne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of niggard Nature, like a pompous bride</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did decke her, and too lavishly adorne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When forth from virgin bowre she comes in th’early morne.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Therewith the Heavens alwayes joviall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lookte on them lovely, still in stedfast state,</span>

					<span class="i1">Ne suffred storme nor frost on them to fall,</span>

					<span class="i1">Their tender buds or leaves to violate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor scorching heat, nor cold intemperate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">T’afflict the creatures which therein did dwell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But the milde ayre with season moderate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gently attempred, and disposd so well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That still it breathed forth sweet spirit and holesom smell:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>More sweet and holesome then the pleasaunt hill</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Rhodope, on which the Nimphe that bore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A gyaunt babe herselfe for griefe did kill;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or the Thessalian Tempe, where of yore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fayre Daphne Phœbus hart with love did gqre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or Ida, where the Gods lov’d to repayre,</span>

					<span class="i1">When ever they their heavenly bowres forlore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or sweet Parnasse, the haunt of Muses fayre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or Eden selfe, if ought with Eden mote compayre.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Much wondred Guyon at the fayre aspect</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that sweet place, yet suffred no delight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To sincke into his sence, nor mind affect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But passed forth, and lookt still forward right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Brydling his will and maystering his might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till that he came unto another gate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No gate, but like one, being goodly dight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With bowes and braunches, which did broad dilate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their clasping armes in wanton wreathings intricate:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So fashioned a Porch with rare device,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Archt over head with an embracing vine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose bounches hanging downe seemd to entice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All passers by to taste their lushious wine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And did them selves into their hands incline,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As freely offering to be gathered;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some deepe empurpled as the Hyacine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some as the Rubine laughing sweetely red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some like faire Emeraudes, not yet well ripened.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And them amongst some were of burnisht gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So made by art to beautify the rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which did themselves emongst the leaves enfold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As lurking from the vew of covetous guest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the weake boughes, with so rich load opprest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did bow adowne as overburdened.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under that Porch a comely dame did rest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Clad in fayre weedes but fowle disordered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And garments loose that seemd unmeet for womanhed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In her left hand a Cup of gold she held,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with her right the riper fruit did reach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose sappy liquor, that with fulnesse sweld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into her cup she scruzd with daintie breach</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of her fine fingers, without fowle empeach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That so faire winepresse made the wine more sweet:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereof she usd to give to drinke to each,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom passing by she happened to meet:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It was her guise all Straungers goodly so to greet.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So she to Guyon offred it to tast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, taking it out of her tender hond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The cup to ground did violently cast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all in peeces it was broken fond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with the liquor stained all the lond:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat Excesse exceedingly was wroth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet no’te the same amend, ne yet withstond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But suffered him to passe, all were she loth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who, nought regarding her displeasure, forward goth.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There the most daintie Paradise on ground</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It selfe doth offer to his sober eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which all pleasures plenteously abownd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And none does others happinesse envye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The painted flowres, the trees upshooting hye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The dales for shade, the hilles for breathing space,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The trembling groves, the christall running by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, that which all faire workes doth most aggrace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The art which all that wrought appeared in no place.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One would have thought, (so cunningly the rude</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And scorned partes were mingled with the fine)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That nature had for wantonesse ensude</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Art, and that Art at nature did repine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So striving each th’other to undermine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Each did the others worke more beautify;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So differing both in willes agreed in fine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So all agreed, through sweete diversity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Gardin to adorne with all variety.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And in the midst of all a fountaine stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of richest substance that on earth might bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So pure and shiny that the silver flood</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through every channell running one might see;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Most goodly it with curious ymageree</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was overwrought, and shapes of naked boyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which some seemd with lively jollitee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To fly about, playing their wanton toyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whylest others did them selves embay in liquid joyes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And over all of purest gold was spred</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A trayle of yvie in his native hew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the rich metall was so coloured,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That wight who did not well avis’d it vew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would surely deeme it to bee yvie trew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Low his lascivious armes adown did creepe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That themselves dipping in the silver dew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their fleecy flowres they fearefully did steepe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which drops of Christall seemd for wantones to weep.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Infinit streames continually did well</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of this fountaine, sweet and faire to see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which into an ample laver fell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And shortly grew into so great quantitie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That like a litle lake it seemd to bee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose depth exceeded not three cubits hight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That through the waves one might the bottom see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All pav’d beneath with Jaspar shining bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That seemd the fountaine in that sea did sayle upright.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And all the margent round about was sett</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With shady Laurell trees, thence to defend</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sunny beames which on the billowes bett,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And those which therein bathed mote offend.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As Guyon hapned by the same to wend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Two naked Damzelles he therein espyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which therein bathing seemed to contend</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wrestle wantonly, ne car’d to hyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their dainty partes from vew of any which them eyd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sometimes the one would lift the other quight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above the waters, and then downe againe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her plong, as over-maystered by might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where both awhile would covered remaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And each the other from to rise restraine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whiles their snowy limbes, as through a vele,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So through the christall waves appeared plaine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then suddeinly both would themselves unhele,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And th’amarous sweet spoiles to greedy eyes revele.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As that faire Starre, the messenger of morne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His deawy face out of the sea doth reare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or as the Cyprian goddesse, newly borne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of th’Ocean’s fruitfull froth, did first appeare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such seemed they, and so their yellow heare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Christalline humor dropped downe apace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom such when Guyon saw, he drew him neare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And somewhat gan relent his earnest pace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His stubborne brest gan secret pleasaunce to embrace.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The wanton Maidens, him espying, stood</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gazing awhile at his unwonted guise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then th’one her selfe low ducked in the flood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Abasht that her a straunger did avise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But thother rather higher did arise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And her two lilly paps aloft displayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all that might his melting hart entyse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To her delights she unto him bewrayd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rest hidd underneath him more desirous made.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that the other likewise up arose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And her faire lockes, which formerly were bown’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up in one knott, she low adowne did lose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which flowing low and thick her cloth’d arownd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And th’yvorie in golden mantle gownd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that faire spectacle from him was reft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet that which reft it no lesse faire was fownd.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So hidd in lockes and waves from lookers theft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nought but her lovely face she for his looking left.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Withall she laughed, and she blusht withall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That blushing to her laughter gave more grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And laughter to her blushing, as did fall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now when they spyde the knight to slacke his pace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Them to behold, and in his sparkling face</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The secrete signes of kindled lust appeare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their wanton meriments they did encreace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to him beckned to approch more neare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shewd him many sights that corage cold could reare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>On which when gazing him the Palmer saw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He much rebukt those wandring eyes of his,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And counseld well him forward thence did draw.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now are they come nigh to the Bowre of blis,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of her fond favorites so nam’d amis,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When thus the Palmer: “Now, Sir, well avise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For here the end of all our traveill is:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here wonnes Acrasia, whom we must surprise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Els she will slip away, and all our drift despise.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Eftsoones they heard a most melodious sound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all that mote delight a daintie eare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such as attonce might not on living ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Save in this Paradise, be heard elsewhere:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Right hard it was for wight which did it heare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To read what manner musicke that mote bee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For all that pleasing is to living eare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was there consorted in one harmonee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Birdes, voices, instruments, windes, waters, all agree</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The joyous birdes, shrouded in chearefull shade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their notes unto the voice attempred sweet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Th’Angelicall soft trembling voyces made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To th’instruments divine respondence meet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The silver sounding instruments did meet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the base murmure of the waters fall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The waters fall with difference discreet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now soft, now loud, unto the wind did call;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The gentle warbling wind low answered to all.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There, whence that Musick seemed heard to bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was the faire Witch her selfe now solacing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With a new Lover, whom, through sorceree</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And witchcraft, she from farre did thither bring:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There she had him now laid aslombering</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In secret shade after long wanton joyes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whilst round about them pleasauntly did sing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Many faire Ladies and lascivious boyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ever mixt their song with light licentious toyes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And all that while right over him she hong</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With her false eyes fast fixed in his sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As seeking medicine whence she was stong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or greedily depasturing delight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And oft inclining downe, with kisses light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For feare of waking him, his lips bedewd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And through his humid eyes did sucke his spright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Quite molten into lust and pleasure lewd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherewith she sighed soft, as if his case she rewd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The whiles some one did chaunt this lovely lay:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ah! see, whoso fayre thing doest faine to see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In springing flowre the image of thy day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ah! see the Virgin Rose, how sweetly shee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth first peepe foorth with bashfull modestee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That fairer seemes the lesse ye see her may.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lo! see soone after how more bold and free</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her bared bosome she doth broad display;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo! see soone after how she fades and falls away.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So passeth, in the passing of a day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of mortall life the leafe, the bud, the flowre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne more doth florish after first decay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That earst was sought to deck both bed and bowre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of many a lady’, and many a Paramowre.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gather therefore the Rose whilest yet is prime,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For soone comes age that will her pride deflowre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gather the Rose of love whilest yet is time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whilest loving thou mayst loved be with equall crime.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He ceast; and then gan all the quire of birdes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their diverse notes t’attune unto his lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As in approvaunce of his pleasing wordes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The constant payre heard all that he did say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet swarved not, but kept their forward way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through many covert groves and thickets close,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which they creeping did at last display</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That wanton Lady with her lover lose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose sleepie head she in her lap did soft dispose.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Upon a bed of Roses she was layd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As faint through heat, or dight to pleasant sin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And was arayd, or rather disarayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All in a vele of silke and silver thin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That hid no whit her alablaster skin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But rather shewd more white, if more might bee:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More subtile web Arachne cannot spin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor the fine nets, which oft we woven see</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of scorched deaw, do not in th’ayre more lightly flee.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Her snowy brest was bare to ready spoyle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of hungry eies, which n’ote therewith be fild;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And yet, through languour of her late sweet toyle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Few drops, more cleare then Nectar, forth distild,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That like pure Orient perles adowne it trild;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And her faire eyes, sweet smyling in delight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Moystened their fierie beames, with which she thrild</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fraile harts, yet quenched not; like starry light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which, sparckling on the silent waves, does seeme more bright.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The young man, sleeping by her, seemd to be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some goodly swayne of honorable place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That certes it great pitty was to see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him his nobility so fowle deface:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A sweet regard and amiable grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mixed with manly sternesse, did appeare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet sleeping, in his well proportiond face;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on his tender lips the downy heare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did now but freshly spring, and silken blossoms beare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His warlike Armes, the ydle instruments</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of sleeping praise, were hong upon a tree;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And his crave shield, full of old moniments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was fowly ras’t, that none the signes might see:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne for them ne for honour cared hee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ought that did to his advauncement tend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But in lewd loves, and wastfull luxuree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His dayes, his goods, his bodie, he did spend:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O horrible enchantment, that him so did blend!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The noble Elfe and carefull Palmer drew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So nigh them, minding nought but lustfull game</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That suddein forth they on them rusht, and threw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A subtile net, which only for that same</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The skilfull Palmer formally did frame:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So held them under fast; the whiles the rest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fled all away for feare of fowler shame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The faire Enchauntresse, so unwares opprest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tryde all her arts and all her sleights thence out to wrest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And eke her lover strove, but all in vaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For that same net so cunningly was wound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That neither guile nor force might it distraine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They tooke them both, and both them strongly bound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In captive bandes, which there they readie found:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But her in chaines of adamant he tyde;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For nothing else might keepe her safe and sound:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Verdant (so he hight) he soone untyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And counsell sage in steed thereof to him applyde.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But all those pleasaunt bowres, and Pallace brave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Guyon broke downe with rigour pittilesse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ought their goodly workmanship might save</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Them from the tempest of his wrathfulnesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that their blisse he turn’d to balefulnesse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their groves he feld; their gardins did deface;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their arbers spoyle; their Cabinets suppresse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their banket houses burne; their buildings race;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, of the fayrest late, now made the fowlest place.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then led they her away, and eke that knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They with them led, both sorrowfull and sad.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The way they came, the same retourn’d they right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till they arrived where they lately had</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Charm’d those wild-beasts that rag’d with furie mad;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which, now awaking, fierce at them gan fly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As in their mistresse reskew whom they lad;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But them the Palmer soone did pacify.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then Guyon askt, what meant those beastes which there did ly?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sayd he; “These seeming beasts are men indeed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom this Enchauntresse hath transformed thus;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whylome her lovers, which her lustes did feed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now turned into figures hideous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">According to their mindes like monstruous.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Sad end,” (quoth he) “of life intemperate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And mourneful meed of joyes delicious!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, Palmer, if it mote thee so aggrate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let them returned be unto their former state.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Streight way he with his vertuous staffe them strooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And streight of beastes they comely men became;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet being men they did unmanly looke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And stared ghastly; some for inward shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And some for wrath to see their captive Dame:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But one above the rest in speciall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That had an hog beene late, hight Grylle by name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Repyned greatly, and did him miscall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That had from hoggish forme him brought to naturall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Saide Guyon; “See the mind of beastly man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That hath so soone forgot the excellence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his creation, when he life began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That now he chooseth with vile difference</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be a beast, and lacke intelligence!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom the Palmer thus: “The donghill kinde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Delightes in filth and fowle incontinence:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let Gryll be Gryll, and have his hoggish minde;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But let us hence depart whilest wether serves and winde.”</span>
