				<p>
					<span>So oft as I with state of present time</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The image of the antique world compare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When as mans age was in his freshest prime,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the first blossome of faire vertue bare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such oddes I finde twixt those, and these which are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As that, through long continuance of his course,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Me seemes the world is runne quite out of square</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the first point of his appointed sourse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And being once amisse growes daily wourse and wourse:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For from the golden age, that first was named,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It’s now at earst become a stonie one;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And men themselves, the which at first were framed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of earthly mould, and form’d of flesh and bone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are now transformed into hardest stone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such as behind their backs (so backward bred)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were throwne by Pyrrha and Deucalione:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And if then those may any worse be red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They into that ere long will be degendered.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Let none then blame me, if in discipline</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of vertue and of civill uses lore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I doe not forme them to the common line</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of present dayes, which are corrupted sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But to the antique use which was of yore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When good was onely for it selfe desyred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all men sought their owne, and none no more;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When Justice was not for most meed out-hyred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But simple Truth did rayne, and was of all admyred.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For that which all men then did vertue call,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is now cald vice; and that which vice was hight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is now hight vertue, and so us’d of all:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Right now is wrong, and wrong that was is right;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As all things else in time are chaunged quight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne wonder; for the heavens revolution</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is wandred farre from where it first was pight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And so doe make contrarie constitution</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all this lower world, toward his dissolution.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For who so list into the heavens looke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And search the courses of the rowling spheares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall find that from the point where they first tooke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their setting forth, in these few thousand yeares</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They all are wandred much; that plaine appeares:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For that same golden fleecy Ram, which bore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Phrixus and Helle from their step-dames feares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hath now forgot where he was plast of yore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shouldred hath the Bull which fayre Europa bore</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And eke the Bull hath with his bow-bent home</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So hardly butted those two twins of Jove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That they have crusht the Crab, and quite him borne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the great Nemasan lions grove.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So now all range, and doe at randon rove</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of their proper places farre away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all this world with them amisse doe move,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all his creatures from their course astray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till they arrive at their last ruinous decay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ne is that same great glorious lampe of light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That doth enlumine all these lesser fyres,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In better case, ne keepes his course more right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But is miscaried with the other Spheres:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For since the terme of fourteene hundred yeres,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That learned Ptolomase his hight did take,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He is declyned from that marke of theirs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nigh thirtie minutes to the Southerne lake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That makes me feare in time he will us quite forsake.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And if to those Egyptian wisards old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which in Star-read were wont have best insight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Faith may be given, it is by them told</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That since the time they first tooke the Sunnes hight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Foure times his place he shifted hath in sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And twice hath risen where he now doth West,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wested twice where he ought rise aright:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But most is Mars amisse of all the rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And next to him old Saturne, that was wont be best.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For during Saturnes ancient raigne it’s sayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all the world with goodnesse did abound:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All loved vertue, no man was affrayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of force, ne fraud in wight was to be found:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No warre was knowne, no dreadfull trompets sound;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Peace universall rayn’d mongst men and beasts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all things freely grew out of the ground:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Justice sate high ador’d with solemne feasts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to all people did divide her dred beheasts:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Most sacred vertue she of all the rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Resembling God in his imperiall might;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose soveraine powre is herein most exprest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That both to good and bad he dealeth right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all his workes with Justice hath bedight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That powre he also doth to Princes lend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And makes them like himselfe in glorious sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To sit in his own seate, his cause to end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And rule his people right, as he doth recommend.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Dread Soverayne Goddesse, that doest highest sit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In seate of judgement in th’Almighties stead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with magnificke might and wondrous wit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doest to thy people righteous doome aread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That furthest Nations filles with awful dread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pardon the boldnesse of thy basest thrall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That dare discourse of so divine a read</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As thy great justice, praysed over-all;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The instrument whereof loe! here thy Artegall.</span>

					<span>Though vertue then were held in highest price,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In those old times of which I doe entreat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet then likewise the wicked seede of vice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began to spring; which shortly grew full great,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with their boughes the gentle plants did beat:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But evermore some of the vertuous race</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rose up, inspired with heroicke heat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That cropt the branches of the sient base,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with strong hand their fruitful rancknes did deface.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Such first was Bacchus, that with furious might</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All th’East, before untam’d, did over-ronne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wrong repressed, and establisht right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which lawlesse men had formerly fordonne:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There Justice first her princely rule begonne.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Next Hercules his like ensample shewed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who all the West with equall conquest wonne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And monstrous tyrants with his club subdewed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The club of Justice dread with kingly powre endewed,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And such was he of whom I have to tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Champion of true Justice, Artegall:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom (as ye lately mote remember well)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An hard adventure, which did then befall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into redoubted perill forth did call;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That was to succour a distressed Dame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom a strong tyrant did unjustly thrall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from the heritage, which she did clame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did with strong hand withhold; Grantorto was his name.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Wherefore the Lady, which Irena hight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did to the Faery Queene her way addresse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom complayning her afflicted plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She her besought of gratious redresse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That soveraine Queene, that mightie Emperesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose glorie is to aide all suppliants pore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of weake Princes to be Patronesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Chose Artegall to right her to restore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that to her he seem’d best skild in righteous lore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For Artegall injustice was upbrought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even from the cradle of his infancie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the depth of rightfull doome was taught</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By faire Astraea with great industrie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whilest here on earth she lived mortallie:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For till the world from his perfection fell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into all filth and foule iniquitie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Astraea here mongst earthly men did dwell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the rules of justice them instructed well.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whiles through the world she walked in this sort,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon a day she found this gentle childe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Amongst his peres playing his childish sport;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom seeing fit, and with no crime defilde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She did allure with gifts and speaches milde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To wend with her. So thence him farre she brought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into a cave from companie exilde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which she noursled him till yeares he raught,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the discipline of justice there him taught.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There she him taught to weigh both right and wrong</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In equal ballance with due recompence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And equitie to measure out along</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">According to the line of conscience,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When so it needs with rigour to dispence:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all the which, for want there of mankind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She caused him to make experience</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon wyld beasts, which she in woods did find</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With wrongfull powre oppressing others of their kind.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus she him trayned, and thus she him taught</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In all the skill of deeming wrong and right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Untill the ripenesse of mans yeares he raught;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That even wilde beasts did feare his awfull sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And men admyr’d his over-ruling might;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne any liv’d on ground that durst withstand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His dreadfull heast, much lesse him match in fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or bide the horror of his wreakfull hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When so he list in wrath lift up his steely brand.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which steely brand, to make him dreaded more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She gave unto him, gotten by her slight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And earnest search, where it was kept in store</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In Joves eternall house, unwist of wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since he himselfe it us’d in that great fight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against the Titans, that whylome rebelled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gainst highest heaven: Chrysaor it was hight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Chrysaor, that all other swords excelled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well prov’d in that same day when Jove those Gyants quelled</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For of most perfect metall it was made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tempred with Adamant amongst the same,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And garnisht all with gold upon the blade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In goodly wise, whereof it tooke his name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And was of no lesse vertue then of fame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For there no substance was so firme and hard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But it would pierce or cleave, where so it came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne any armour could his dint out-ward;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But wheresoever it did light, it throughly shard.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now, when the world with sinne gan to abound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Astraea loathing lenger here to space</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mongst wicked men, in whom no truth she found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Return’d to heaven, whence she deriv’d her race;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where she hath now an everlasting place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mongst those twelve signes, which nightly we doe see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The heavens bright-shining baudricke to enchace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And is the Virgin, sixt in her degree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And next her selfe her righteous ballance hanging bee.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But when she parted hence she left her groome,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An yron man, which did on her attend</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Alwayes to execute her stedfast doome,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And willed him with Artegall to wend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And doe what ever thing he did intend:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His name was Talus, made of yron mould,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Immoveable, resistlesse, without end;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who in his hand a yron flale did hould,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With which he thresht out falshood, and did truth unfould.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He now went with him in this new inquest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him for to aide, if aide he chaunst to neede,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against that cruell Tyrant, which opprest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The faire Irena with his foule misdeede,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And kept the crowne in which she should succeed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now together on their way they bin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When as they saw a Squire in squallid weed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lamenting sore his sorrowfull sad tyne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With many bitter teares shed from his blubbred eyne.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To whom as they approched, they espide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A sorie sight as ever scene with eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An headlesse Ladie lying him beside</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In her owne blood all wallow’d wofully,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That her gay clothes did in discolour die.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Much was he moved at that ruefull sight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And flam’d with zeale of vengeance inwardly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He askt who had that Dame so fouly dight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or whether his owne hand, or whether other wight?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Ah! woe is me, and well-away!” (quoth hee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bursting forth teares like springs out of a banke),</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“That ever I this dismall day did see!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full farre was I from thinking such a pranke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet litle losse it were, and mickle thanke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If I should graunt that I have doen the same,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I mote drinke the cup whereof she dranke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that I should die guiltie of the blame</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The which another did, who now is fled with shame.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Who was it then,” (sayd Artegall) “that wrought?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And why? doe it declare unto me trew.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“A knight,” (said he) “if knight he may be thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That did his hand in Ladies bloud embrew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And for no cause, but as I shall you shew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This day as I in solace sate hereby</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With a fayre love, whose losse I now do rew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There came this knight, having in companie</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This lucklesse Ladie which now here doth headlesse lie.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“He, whether mine seem’d fayrer in his eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or that he wexed weary of his owne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would change with me, but I did it denye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So did the Ladies both, as may be knowne:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he, whose spirit was with pride upblowne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would not so rest contented with his right;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, having from his courser her downe throwne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fro me reft mine away by lawlesse might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on his steed her set to beare her out of sight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Which when his Ladie saw, she follow’d fast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on him catching hold gan loud to crie</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not so to leave her, nor away to cast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But rather of his hand besought to die.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With that his sword he drew all wrathfully,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And at one stroke cropt off her head with scorne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In that same place whereas it now doth lie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So he my love away with him hath borne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And left me here both his and mine owne love to morne.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Aread” (sayd he) “which way then did he make?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by what markes may he be knowne againe?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“To hope” (quoth he) “him soone to overtake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That hence so long departed, is but vaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But yet he pricked over yonder plaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, as I marked, bore upon his shield,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By which it’s easie him to know againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A broken sword within a bloodie field;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Expressing well his nature which the same did wield.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>No sooner sayd, but streight he after sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His yron page, who him pursew’d so light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As that it seem’d above the ground he went;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For he was swift as swallow in her flight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And strong as Lyon in his lordly might.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It was not long before he overtooke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sir Sanglier, (so cleeped was that Knight)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom at the first he ghessed by his looke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by the other markes which of his shield he tooke.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He bad him stay, and backe with him retire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, full of scorne to be commaunded so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Lady to alight did eft require,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whilest he reformed that uncivill fo,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And streight at him with all his force did go;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who mov’d no more therewith, then when a rocke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is lightly stricken with some stones throw;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But to him leaping lent him such a knocke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That on the ground he layd him like a sencelesse blocke.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, ere he could him selfe recure againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him in his iron paw he seized had;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That when he wak’t out of his warelesse paine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He found him selfe unwist so ill bestad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That lim he could not wag: Thence he him lad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bound like a beast appointed to the stall:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sight whereof the Lady sore adrad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fain’d to fly for feare of being thrall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he her quickly stayd, and forst to wend withall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When to the place they came, where Artegall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By that same carefull Squire did then abide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He gently gan him to demaund of all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That did betwixt him and that Squire betide:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who with sterne countenance and indignant pride</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did aunswere, that of all he guiltlesse stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And his accuser thereuppon deride;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For neither he did shed that Ladies bloud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor tooke away his love, but his owne proper good.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Well did the Squire perceive him selfe too weake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To aunswere his defiaunce in the field,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And rather chose his challenge off to breake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then to approve his right with speare and shield,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And rather guilty chose himselfe to yield:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Artegall by signes perceiving plaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he it was not which that Lady kild,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that strange Knight, the fairer love to gaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did cast about by sleight the truth thereout to straine;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And sayd; “Now sure this doubtfull causes right</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Can hardly but by Sacrament be tride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or else by ordele, or by blooddy fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ill perhaps mote fall to either side;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But if ye please that I your cause decide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perhaps I may all further quarrell end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So ye will sweare my judgement to abide.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereto they both did franckly condiscend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to his doome with listfull eares did both attend.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Sith then,” (sayd he) “ye both the dead deny,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And both the living Lady claime your right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let both the dead and living equally</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Devided be betwixt you here in sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And each of either take his share aright:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But looke, who does dissent from this my read,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He for a twelve moneths day shall in despight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beare for his penaunce that same Ladies head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To witnesse to the world that she by him is dead.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Well pleased with that doome was Sangliere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And offred streight the Lady to be slaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that same Squire, to whom she was more dere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When as he saw she should be cut in twaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did yield she rather should with him remaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Alive, then to him selfe be shared dead;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And rather then his love should suffer paine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He chose with shame to beare that Ladies head:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>True love despiseth shame, when life is cald in dread.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whom when so willing Artegall perceaved;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Not so, thou Squire,” (he sayd) “but thine I deeme</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The living Lady, which from thee he reaved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For worthy thou of her doest rightly seeme.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And you, Sir Knight, that love so light esteeme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As that ye would for little leave the same,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Take here your owne, that doth you best beseeme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with it beare the burden of defame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your owne dead Ladies head, to tell abrode your shame.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Sangliere disdained much his doome,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sternly gan repine at his beheast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne would for ought obay, as did become,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To beare that Ladies head before his breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until that Talus had his pride represt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And forced him, maulgre, it up to reare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who when he saw it bootelesse to resist,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He tooke it up, and thence with him did beare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As rated Spaniell takes his burden up for feare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Much did that Squire Sir Artegall adore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For his great justice, held in high regard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And as his Squire him offred evermore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To serve, for want of other meete reward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wend with him on his adventure hard;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he thereto would by no meanes consent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But leaving him forth on his journey far’d:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne wight with him but onely Talus went;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They two enough t’encounter an whole Regiment.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Who now to perils great for justice sake proceedes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To which as he now was uppon the way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He chaunst to meet a Dwarfe in hasty course,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom he requir’d his forward hast to stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till he of tidings mote with him discourse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Loth was the Dwarfe, yet did he stay perforse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gan of sundry newes his store to tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As to his memory they had recourse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But chiefly of the fairest Florimell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How she was found againe, and spousde to Marinell.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For this was Dony, Florimels owne Dwarfe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom having lost, (as ye have heard whyleare)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And finding in the way the scattred scarfe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The fortune of her life long time did feare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But of her health when Artegall did heare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And safe returne, he was full inly glad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And askt him where and when her bridale cheare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should be solemniz’d; for, if time he had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would be there, and honor to her spousall ad.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Within three daies,” (quoth he) “as I do here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It will be at the Castle of the Strond;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What time, if naught me let, I will be there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To doe her service so as I am bond:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But in my way, a little here beyond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A cursed cruell Sarazin doth wonne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That keepes a Bridges passage by strong hond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And many errant Knights hath there fordonne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That makes all men for feare that passage for to shonne.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“What mister wight,” (quoth he) “and how far hence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is he, that doth to travellers such harmes?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“He is” (said he) “a man of great defence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Expert in battell and in deedes of armes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more emboldned by the wicked charmes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which his daughter doth him still support;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Having great Lordships got and goodly farmes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through strong oppression of his powre extort,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By which he stil them holds, and keepes with strong effort.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“And dayly he his wrongs encreaseth more;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For never wight he lets to passe that way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Over his Bridge, albee he rich or poore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he him makes his passage-penny pay:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Else he doth hold him backe or beat away.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereto he hath a groome of evill guize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose scalp is bare, that bondage doth bewray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which pols and pils the poore in piteous wize;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he him selfe uppon the rich doth tyrannize.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“His name is hight Pollente, rightly so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For that he is so puissant and strong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with his powre he all doth overgo,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And makes them subject to his mighty wrong;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And some by sleight he eke doth underfong.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For on a Bridge he custometh to fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which is but narrow, but exceeding long;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in the same are many trap-fals pight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through which the rider downe doth fall through oversight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“And underneath the same a river flowes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That is both swift and dangerous deepe withall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the which whom so he overthrowes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All destitute of helpe doth headlong fall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he him selfe through practise usuall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Leapes forth into the floud, and there assaies</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His foe confused through his sodaine fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That horse and man he equally dismaies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And either both them drownes, or trayterously slaies.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Then doth he take the spoile of them at will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to his daughter brings, that dwels thereby;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who all that comes doth take, and therewith fill</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The coffers of her wicked threasury,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which she with wrongs hath heaped up so hy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That many Princes she in wealth exceedes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And purchast all the countrey lying ny</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the revenue of her plenteous meedes:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her name is Munera, agreeing with her deedes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Thereto she is full faire, and rich attired,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With golden hands and silver feete beside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That manv Lords have her to wife desired,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But she them all despiseth for great pride.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Now by my life,” (sayd he) “and God to guide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">None other way will I this day betake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But by that Bridge whereas he doth abide:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore me thither lead.” No more he spake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But thitherward forthright his ready way did make.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Unto the place he came within a while,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where on the Bridge he ready armed saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Sarazin, awayting for some spoile:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When as they to the passage gan to draw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A villaine to them came with scull all raw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That passage money did of them require,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">According to the custome of their law:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom he aunswerd wroth, “Loe! there thy hire;”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with that word him strooke, that streight he did expire.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when the Pagan saw he wexed wroth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And streight him selfe unto the fight addrest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne was Sir Artegall behmde: so both</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Together ran with ready speares in rest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Right in the midst, whereas they brest to brest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should meete, a trap was letten downe to fall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the floud: streight leapt the Carle unblest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well weening that his foe was falne withall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he was well aware, and leapt before his fall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There being both together in the floud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They each at other tyrannously flew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ought the water cooled their whot bloud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But rather in them kindled choler new:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But there the Paynim, who that use well knew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To fight in water, great advantage had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That oftentimes him nigh he overthrew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke the courser whereuppon he rad</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could swim like to a fish, whiles he his backe bestrad.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which oddes when as Sir Artegall espide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He saw no way but close with him in hast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to him driving strongly downe the tide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uppon his iron coller griped fast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with the straint his wesand nigh he brast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There they together strove and struggled long</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Either the other from his steede to cast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ever Artegall his griple strong</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For any thing wold slacke, but still upon him hong.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As when a Dolphin and a Sele are met</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the wide champian of the Ocean plaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With cruell chaufe their courages they whet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The maysterdome of each by force to gaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And dreadfull battaile twixt them do darraine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They snuf, they snort, they bounce, they rage, they rore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all the sea, disturbed with their traine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth frie with fome above the surges hore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such was betwixt these two the troublesome uprore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So Artegall at length him forst forsake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His horses backe for dread of being drownd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to his handy swimming him betake.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eftsoones him selfe he from his hold unbownd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then no ods at all in him he fownd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For Artegall in swimming skilfull was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And durst the depth of any water sownd.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So ought each Knight, that use of perill has,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In swimming be expert, through waters force to pas.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then very doubtfull was the warres event,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uncertaine whether had the better side;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For both were skild in that experiment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And both in armes well traind, and throughly tride:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Artegall was better breath’d beside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And towards th’end grew greater in his might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That his faint foe no longer could abide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His puissance, ne beare him selfe upright;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But from the water to the land betooke his flight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Artegall pursewd him still so neare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With bright Chrysaor in his cruell hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That as his head he gan a litle reare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above the brincke to tread upon the land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He smote it off, that tumbling on the strand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It bit the earth for very fell despight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gnashed with his teeth, as if he band</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">High God, whose goodnesse he despaired quight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or curst the hand which did that vengeance on him dight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His corps was carried downe along the Lee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose waters with his filthy bloud it stayned;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But his blasphemous head, that all might see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He pitcht upon a pole on high ordayned;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where many years it afterwards remayned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be a mirrour to all mighty men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In whose right hands great power is contayned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That none of them the feeble over-ren,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But alwaies doe their powre within just compasse pen.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>That done, unto the Castle he did wend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which the Paynims daughter did abide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Guarded of many which did her defend:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of whom he entrance sought, but was denide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with reprochfull blasphemy defide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beaten with stones downe from the battilment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he was forced to withdraw aside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And bad his servant Talus to invent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which way he enter might without endangerment.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Eftsoones his Page drew to the Castle gate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with his iron flale at it let flie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all the warders it did sore amate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which erewhile spake so reprochfully,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And made them stoupe that looked earst so hie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet still he bet and bounst uppon the dore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thundred strokes thereon so hideouslie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all the peece he shaked from the flore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And filled all the house with feare and great uprore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With noise whereof the Lady forth appeared</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uppon the Castle wall; and, when she saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The daungerous state in which she stood, she feared</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sad effect of her neare overthrow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gan entreat that iron man below</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To cease his outrage, and him faire besought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sith neither force of stones which they did throw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor powr of charms, which she against him wrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Might otherwise prevaile, or make him cease for ought.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, when as yet she saw him to proceede</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unmov’d with praiers or with piteous thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She ment him to corrupt with goodly meede;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And causde great sackes with endlesse riches fraught</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the battilment to be upbrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And powred forth over the Castle wall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That she might win some time, though dearly bought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whilest he to gathering of the gold did fall:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he was nothing mov’d nor tempted therewithall:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But still continu’d his assault the more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And layd on load with his huge yron flaile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That at the length he has yrent the dore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And made way for his maister to assaile;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who being entred, nought did then availe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For wight against his powre them selves to reare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Each one did flie; their hearts began to faile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hid them selves in corners here and there;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke their dame halfe dead did hide her self for feare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Long they her sought, yet no where could they finde her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That sure they ween’d she was escapt away;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Talus, that could like a lime-hound winde her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all things secrete wisely could bewray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At length found out whereas she hidden lay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under an heape of gold. Thence he her drew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By the faire lockes, and fowly did array</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Withouten pitty of her goodly hew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Artegall him selfe her seemelesse plight did rew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet for no pitty would he change the course</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Justice, which in Talus hand did lye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who rudely hayld her forth without remorse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still holding up her suppliant hands on hye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And kneeling at his feete submissively:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he her suppliant hands, those hands of gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke her feete, those feete of silver trye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which sought unrighteousnesse, and justice sold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Chopt off, and nayld on high that all might them behold.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Her selfe then tooke he by the sclender wast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In vaine loud crying, and into the flood</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Over the Castle wall adowne her cast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And there her drowned in the durty mud;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But the streame washt away her guilty blood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereafter all that mucky pelfe he tooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The spoile of peoples evil gotten good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which her sire had scrap’t by hooke and crooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And burning all to ashes powr’d it downe the brooke.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And lastly all that Castle quite he raced,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even from the sole of his foundation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the hewen stones thereof defaced,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That there mote be no hope of reparation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor memory thereof to any nation.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All which when Talus throughly had perfourmed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sir Artegall undid the evill fashion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wicked customes of that Bridge refourmed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which done, unto his former journey he retourned:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In which they measur’d mickle weary way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till that at length nigh to the sea they drew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By which as they did travell on a day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They saw before them, far as they could vew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full many people gathered in a crew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose great assembly they did much admire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For never there the like resort they knew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So towardes them they coasted, to enquire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What thing so many nations met did there desire.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There they beheld a mighty Gyant stand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon a rocke, and holding forth on hie</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An huge great paire of ballance in his hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which he boasted, in his surquedrie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all the world he would weigh equallie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If ought he had the same to counterpoys;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For want whereof he weighed vanity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fild his ballaunce full of idle toys:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet was admired much of fooles, women, and boys.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He sayd that he would all the earth uptake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the sea, divided each from either:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So would he of the fire one ballaunce make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And one of th’ayre, without or wind or wether:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then would he ballaunce heaven and hell together,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all that did within them all containe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all whose weight he would not misse a fether:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And looke what surplus did of each remaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would to his owne part restore the same againe:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For-why, he sayd, they all unequall were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And had encroched upon others share;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like as the sea (which plaine he shewed there)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had worne the earth; so did the fire the aire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So all the rest did others parts empaire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And so were realmes and nations run awry.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All which he undertooke for to repaire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In sort as they were formed aunciently,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all things would reduce unto equality.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Therefore the vulgar did about him flocke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And cluster thicke unto his leasings vaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like foolish flies about an hony-crocke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In hope by him great benefite to gaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And uncontrolled freedome to obtaine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All which when Artegall did see and heare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How he mis-led the simple peoples traine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In sdeignfull wize he drew unto him neare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus unto him spake, without regard or feare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Thou that presum’st to weigh the world anew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all things to an equall to restore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Instead of right me seemes great wrong dost shew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And far above thy forces pitch to sore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For ere thou limit what is lesse or more</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In every thing, thou oughtest first to know</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What was the poyse of every part of yore:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And looke then how much it doth overflow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or faile thereof, so much is more then just to trow.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“For at the first they all created were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In goodly measure by their Makers might;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And weighed out in ballaunces so nere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That not a dram was missing of their right:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The earth was in the middle centre pight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which it doth immoveable abide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hemd in with waters like a wall in sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And they with aire, that not a drop can slide:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Al which the heavens containe, and in their courses guide.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Such heavenly justice doth among them raine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That every one doe know their certaine bound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which they doe these many yeares remaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And mongst them al no change hath yet beene found;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But if thou now shouldst weigh them new in pound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We are not sure they would so long remaine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All change is perillous, and all chaunce unsound.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore leave off to weigh them all againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till we may be assur’d they shall their course retaine.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Thou foolishe Elfe,” (said then the Gyant wroth)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Seest not how badly all things present bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And each estate quite out of order goth?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sea it selfe doest thou not plainely see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Encroch uppon the land there under thee?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And th’earth it selfe how daily its encreast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By all that dying to it turned be:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were it not good that wrong were then surceast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And from the most that some were given to the least?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Therefore I will throw downe these mountaines hie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And make them levell with the lowly plaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These towring rocks, which reach unto the skie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I will thrust downe into the deepest maine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, as they were, them equalize againe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tyrants, that make men subject to their law,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I will suppresse, that they no more may raine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Lordings curbe that commons over-aw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the wealth of rich men to the poore will draw.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Of things unseene how canst thou deeme aright,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then answered the righteous Artegall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Sith thou misdeem’st so much of things in sight?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What though the sea with waves continuall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doe eate the earth, it is no more at all;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne is the earth the lesse, or loseth ought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For whatsoever from one place doth fall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is with the tide unto another brought:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For there is nothing lost, that may be found if sought.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Likewise the earth is not augmented more</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By all that dying into it doe fade;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For of the earth they formed were of yore:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How ever gay their blossome or their blade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doe flourish now, they into dust shall vade.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What wrong then is it, if that when they die</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They turne to that whereof they first were made?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All in the powre of their great Maker lie:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All creatures must obey the voice of the Most Hie.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“They live, they die, like as he doth ordaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ever any asketh reason why.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The hils doe not the lowly dales disdaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The dales doe not the lofty hils envy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He maketh Kings to sit in soverainty;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He maketh subjects to their powre obay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He pulleth downe, he setteth up on hy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He gives to this, from that he takes away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all we have is his: what he list doe, he may.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“What ever thing is done by him is donne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne any may his mighty will withstand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne any may his soveraine power shonne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne loose that he hath bound with stedfast band.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In vaine therefore doest thou now take in hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To call to count, or weigh his workes anew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose counsels depth thou canst not understand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sith of things subject to thy daily vew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou doest not know the causes, nor their courses dew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“For take thy ballaunce, if thou be so wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And weigh the winde that under heaven doth blow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or weigh the light that in the East doth rise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or weigh the thought that from mans mind doth flow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But if the weight of these thou canst not show,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Weigh but one word which from thy lips doth fall:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For how canst thou those greater secrets know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That doest not know the least thing of them all?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ill can he rule the great that cannot reach the small.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Therewith the Gyant much abashed sayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he of little things made reckoning light;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet the least word that ever could be layd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within his ballaunce he could way aright.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Which is” (sayd he) “more heavy then in weight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The right or wrong, the false or else the trew?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He answered that he would try it streight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So he the words into his ballaunce threw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But streight the winged words out of his ballaunce flew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Wroth wcxt he then, and sayd that words were light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne would within his ballaunce well abide:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he could justly weigh the wrong or right.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Well then,” sayd Artegall, “let it be tride:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">First in one ballance set the true aside.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He did so first, and then the false he layd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In th’other scale; but still it downe did slide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by no meane could in the weight be stayd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For by no meanes the false will with the truth be wayd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Now take the right likewise,” sayd Artegale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“And counterpeise the same with so much wrong.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So first the right he put into one scale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then the Gyant strove with puissance strong</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To fill the other scale with so much wrong;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But all the wrongs that he therein could lay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Might not it peise; yet did he labour long,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And swat, and chauf d, and proved every way:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet all the wrongs could not a litle right downe way.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when he saw he greatly grew in rage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And almost would his balances have broken;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Artegall him fairely gan asswage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said, “Be not upon thy balance wroken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For they doe nought but right or wrong betoken;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But in the mind the doome of right must bee:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And so likewise of words, the which be spoken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The eare must be the ballance, to decree</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And judge, whether with truth or falshood they agree.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But set the truth and set the right aside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For they with wrong or falshood will not fare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And put two wrongs together to be tnde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or else two falses, of each equall share,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then together doe them both compare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For truth is one, and right is ever one.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So did he; and then plaine it did appeare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whether of them the greater were attone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But right sate in the middest of the beame alone.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But he the fight from thence did thrust away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For it was not the right which he did seeke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But rather strove extremities to way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Th’one to diminish, th’other for to eeke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For of the meane he greatly did misleeke.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom when so lewdly minded Talus found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Approching nigh unto him, cheeke by cheeke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He shouldered him from off the higher ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, down the rock him throwing, in the sea him dround.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like as a ship, whom cruell tempest drives</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon a rocke with horrible dismay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her shattered ribs in thousand peeces rives,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And spoyling all her geares and goodly ray</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Does make her selfe misfortunes piteous pray.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So downe the cliffe the wretched Gyant tumbled;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His battred ballances in peeces lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His timbered bones all broken rudely rumbled:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So was the high-aspyring with huge ruine humbled.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>That when the people, which had there about</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Long wayted, saw his sudden desolation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They gan to gather in tumultuous rout,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And mutining to stirre up civill faction</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For certaine losse of so great expectation:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For well they hoped to have got great good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wondrous riches by his innovation.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore resolving to revenge his blood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They rose in armes, and all in battell order stood.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which lawlesse multitude him comming too</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In warlike wise when Artegall did vew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He much was troubled, ne wist what to doo:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For loth he was his noble hands t’embrew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the base blood of such a rascall crew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And otherwise, if that he should retire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He fear’d least they with shame would him pursew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore he Talus to them sent t’inquire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cause of their array, and truce for to desire.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But soone as they him nigh approching spide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They gan with all their weapons him assay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And rudely stroke at him on every side;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet nought they could him hurt, ne ought dismay:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when at them he with his flaile gan lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He like a swarme of flyes them overthrew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne any of them durst come in his way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But here and there before his presence flew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hid themselves in holes and bushes from his vew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As when a Faulcon hath with nimble flight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Flowne at a flush of Ducks foreby the brooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The trembling foule dismayd with dreadfull sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of death, the which them almost overtooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doe hide themselves from her astonying looke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Amongst the flags and covert round about.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When Talus saw they all the field forsooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And none appeared of all that raskall rout,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Artegall he turn’d and went with him throughout.</span>

					<span>To tell the glorie of the feast that day,</span>

					<span class="i1">The goodly service, the devicefull sights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The bridegromes state, the brides most rich aray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The pride of Ladies, and the worth of knights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The royall banquets, and the rare delights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were worke fit for an Herauld, not for me:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But for so much as to my lot here lights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with this present treatise doth agree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>True vertue to advance, shall here recounted bee.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When all men had with full satietie</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of meates and drinkes their appetites suffiz’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To deedes of armes and proofe of chevalrie</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They gan themselves addresse, full rich aguiz’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As each one had his furnitures deviz’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And first of all issu’d Sir Marinell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with him sixe knights more, which enterpriz’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To chalenge all in right of Florimell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to maintaine that she all others did excell.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The first of them was hight Sir Orimont,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A noble Knight, and tride in hard assayes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The second had to name Sir Bellisont,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But second unto none in prowesse prayse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The third was Brunell, famous in his dayes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The fourth Ecastor, of exceeding might;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The fift Armeddan, skild in lovely layes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sixt was Lansack, a redoubted Knight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All sixe well-scene in armes, and prov’d in many a fight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And them against came all that list to giust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From every coast and countrie under sunne:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">None was debard, but all had leave that lust.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The trompets sound, then all together ronne.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full many deeds of armes that day were donne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And many knights unhorst, and many wounded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As fortune fell; yet little lost or wonne:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But all that day the greatest prayse redounded</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Marinell, whose name the Heralds loud resounded.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The second day, so soone as morrow light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Appear’d in heaven, into the field they came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And there all day continew’d cruell fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With divers fortune fit for such a game,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which all strove with perill to winne fame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet whether side was viclor note be ghest:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But at the last the trompets did proclame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Marinell that day deserved best.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So they disparted were, and all men went to rest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The third day came, that should due tryall lend</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all the rest; and then this warlike crew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Together met of all to make an end.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There Marinell great deeds of armes did shew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And through the thickest like a Lyon flew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rashing off helmes, and ry ving plates asonder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That every one his daunger did eschew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So terribly his dreadfull strokes did thonder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That all men stood amaz’d, and at his might did wonder.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But what on earth can alwayes happie stand?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The greater prowesse greater perils find.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So farre he past amongst his enemies band,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That they have him enclosed so behind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As by no meanes he can himselfe outwind:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now perforce they have him prisoner taken;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now they doe with captive bands him bind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now they lead him thence, of all forsaken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unlesse some succour had in time him overtaken.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It fortun’d, whylest they were thus ill beset,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sir Artegall into the Tilt-yard came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With Braggadochio, whom he lately met</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the way with that his snowy Dame:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where when he understood by common fame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What evil hap to Marinell betid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He much was mov’d at so unworthie shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And streight that boaster prayd, with whom he rid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To change his shield with him, to be the better hid.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So forth he went, and soone them over-hent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where they were leading Marinell away;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom he assayld with dreadlesse hardiment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And forst the burden of their prize to stay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They were an hundred knights of that array,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which th’one halfe upon himselfe did set,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The other stayd behind to gard the pray:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he ere long the former fiftie bet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And from the other fiftie soone the prisoner fet.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So backe he brought Sir Marinell againe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom having quickly arm’d againe anew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They both together joyned might and maine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To set afresh on all the other crew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom with sore havocke soone they overthrew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And chaced quite out of the field, that none</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against them durst his head to perill shew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So were they left Lords of the field alone:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So Marinell by him was rescu’d from his fone.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when he had perform’d, then backe againe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To Braggadochio did his shield restore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who all this while behind him did remaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Keeping there close with him in pretious store</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That his false Ladie, as ye heard afore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then did the trompets sound, and Judges rose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all these knights, which that day armour bore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came to the open hall to listen whose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The honour of the prize should be adjudg’d by those.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And thether also came in open sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fayre Florimell, into the common hall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To greet his guerdon unto every knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And best to him to whom the best should fall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then for that stranger knight they loud did call,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom that day they should the girlond yield,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who came not forth; but for Sir Artegall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came Braggadochio, and did shew his shield,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which bore the Sunne brode blazed in a golden field.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The sight whereof did all with gladnesse fill:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So unto him they did addeeme the prise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all that Tryumph. Then the trompets shrill</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Don Braggadochios name resounded thrise:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So courage lent a cloke to cowardise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then to him came fayrest Florimell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And goodly gan to greet his brave emprise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thousand thankes him yeeld, that had so well</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Approv’d that day that she all others did excell.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To whom the boaster, that all knights did blot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With proud disdaine did scornefull answere make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That what he did that day, he did it not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For her, but for his owne deare Ladies sake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom on his perill he did undertake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both her and eke all others to excell:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And further did uncomely speaches crake.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Much did his words the gentle Ladie quell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And turn’d aside for shame to heare what he did tell.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then forth he brought his snowy Florimele,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom Trompart had in keeping there beside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Covered from peoples gazement with a vele:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom when discovered they had throughly eide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With great amazement they were stupefide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said, that surely Florimell it was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or if it were not Florimell so tride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Florimell her selfe she then did pas.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So feeble skill of perfect things the vulgar has.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when as Marinell beheld likewise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He was therewith exceedingly dismayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne wist he what to thinke, or to devise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, like as one whom feends had made affrayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He long astonisht stood, ne ought he sayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ought he did, but with fast fixed eies</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He gazed still upon that snowy mayd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom ever as he did the more avize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The more to be true Florimell he did surmize.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As when two sunnes appeare in the asure skye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mounted in Phoebus charet fierie bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both darting forth faire beames to each mans eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And both adorn’d with lampes of flaming light;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All that behold so strange prodigious sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not knowing natures worke, nor what to weene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are rapt with wonder and with rare affright.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So stood Sir Marinell, when he had scene</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The semblant of this false by his faire beauties Queene.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All which when Artegall, who all this while</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stood in the preasse close covered, well advewed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And saw that boasters pride and gracelesse guile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He could no longer beare, but forth issewed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And unto all himselfe there open shewed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to the boaster said; “Thou losell base,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That hast with borrowed plumes thy selfe endewed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And others worth with leasings doest deface,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they are all restor’d thou shalt rest in disgrace.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“That shield, which thou doest beare, was it indeed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which this dayes honour sav’d to Marinell:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But not that arme, nor thou the man, I reed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which didst that service unto Florimell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For proofe shew forth thy sword, and let it tell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What strokes, what dreadfull stoure, it stird this day;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or shew the wounds which unto thee befell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or shew the sweat with which thou diddest sway</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So sharpe a battell, that so many did dismay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But this the sword which wrought those cruell stounds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this the arme the which that shield did beare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And these the signs” (so shewed forth his wounds)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“By which that glorie gotten doth appeare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As for this Ladie, which he sheweth here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is not (I wager) Florimell at all;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But some fayre Franion, fit for such a fere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That by misfortune in his hand did fall.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For proofe whereof he bad them Florimell forth call.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So forth the noble Ladie was ybrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Adorn’d with honor and all comely grace:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereto her bashful shamefastnesse ywrought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A great increase in her faire blushing face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As roses did with lilies interlace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For of those words, the which that boaster threw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She inly yet conceived great disgrace:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom when as all the people such did vew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They shouted loud, and signes of gladnesse all did shew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then did he set her by that snowy one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like the true saint beside the image set,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of both their beauties to make paragone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And triall, whether should the honor get.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Streight-way, so soone as both together met,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Th’enchaunted Damzell vanisht into nought:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her snowy substance melted as with heat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne of that goodly hew remayned ought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But th’emptie girdle which about her wast was wrought.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As when the daughter of Thaumantes faire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hath in a watry cloud displayed wide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her goodly bow, which paints the liquid ayre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all men wonder at her colours pride;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All suddenly, ere one can looke aside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The glorious picture vanisheth away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne any token doth thereof abide:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So did this Ladies goodly form decay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And into nothing goe, ere one could it bewray.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when as all that present were beheld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They stricken were with great astonishment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And their faint harts with senselesse horrour queld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see the thing, that seem’d so excellent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So stolen from their fancies wonderment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That what of it became none understood:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Braggadochio selfe with dreriment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So daunted was in his despeyring mood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That like a lifelesse corse immoveable he stood.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Artegall that golden belt uptooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which of all her spoyle was onely left;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which was not hers, as many it mistooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Florimells owne girdle, from her reft</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While she was flying, like a weary weft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From that foule monster which did her compell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To perils great; which he unbuckling eft</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Presented to the fayrest Florimell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who round about her tender wast it fitted well.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Full many Ladies often had assayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">About their middles that faire belt to knit;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And many a one suppos’d to be a mayd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet it to none of all their loynes would fit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till Florimell about her fastned it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such power it had, that to no womans wast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By any skill or labour it would sit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unlesse that she were continent and chast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But it would lose or breake, that many had disgrast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whilest thus they busied were bout Florimell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And boastfull Braggadochio, to defame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sir Guyon, as by fortune then befell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forth from the thickest preasse of people came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His owne good steed, which he had stolne, to clame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And th’one hand seizing on his golden bit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With th’other drew his sword; for with the same</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He ment the thiefe there deadly to have smit:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, had he not bene held, he nought had fayld of it.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thereof great hurly-burly moved was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Throughout the hall for that same warlike horse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For Braggadochio would not let him pas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Guyon would him algates have perforse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or it approve upon his carrion corse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which troublous stirre when Artegall perceived,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He nigh them drew to stay th’avengers forse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gan inquire how was that steed bereaved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whether by might extort, or else by slight deceaved?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who all that piteous storie, which befell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">About that wofull couple which were slaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And their young bloodie babe to him gan tell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With whom whiles he did in the wood remaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His horse purloyned was by subtill traine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For which he chalenged the thiefe to fight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he for nought could him thereto constraine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For as the death he hated such despight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And rather had to lose then trie in armes his right.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which Artegall well hearing, (though no more</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By law of armes there neede ones right to trie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As was the wont of warlike knights of yore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then that his foe should him the field denie,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet, further right by tokens to descrie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He askt what privie tokens he did beare?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“If that” (said Guyon) “may you satisfie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within his mouth a blacke spot doth appeare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shapt like a horses shoe, who list to seeke it there.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whereof to make due tryall, one did take</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The horse in hand within his mouth to looke:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But with his heeles so sorely he him strake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all his ribs he quite in peeces broke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That never word from that day forth he spoke.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another, that would seeme to have more wit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him by the bright embrodered hed-stall tooke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But by the shoulder him so sore he bit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he him maymed quite, and all his shoulder split.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ne he his mouth would open unto wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Untill that Guyon selfe unto him spake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And called Brigadore, (so was he hight,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose voice so soone as he did undertake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eftsoones he stood as still as any stake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And suffred all his secret marke to see:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, when as he him nam’d, for joy he brake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His bands, and follow’d him with gladfull glee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And friskt, and flong aloft, and louted low on knee.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thereby Sir Artegall did plaine areed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That unto him the horse belong’d, and sayd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Lo there! Sir Guyon, take to you the steed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he with golden saddle is arayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And let that losell, plainely now displayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hence fare on foot, till he an horse have gayned.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But the proud boaster gan his doome upbrayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And him revil’d, and rated, and disdayned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That judgement so unjust against him had ordayned.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Much was the knight incenst with his lewd word</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To have revenged that his villeny;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thrise did lay his hand upon his sword,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To have him slaine, or dearely doen aby:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Guyon did his choler pacify,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying, “Sir knight, it would dishonour bee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To you that are our judge of equity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To wreake your wrath on such a carle as hee:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It’s punishment enough that all his shame doe see.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So did he mitigate Sir Artegall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Talus by the backe the boaster hent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And drawing him out of the open hall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon him did inflict this punishment:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">First he his beard did shave, and fowly shent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then from him reft his shield, and it renverst,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And blotted out his armes with falshood blent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And himselfe baffuld, and his armes unherst,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And broke his sword in twaine, and all his armour sperst.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The whiles his guilefull groome was fled away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But vaine it was to thinke from him to flie;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who overtaking him did disaray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all his face deform’d with infamie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And out of court him scourged openly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So ought all faytours that true knighthood shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And armes dishonour with base villanie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From all brave knights be banisht with defame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For oft their lewdnes blotteth good deserts with blame.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now when these counterfeits were thus uncased</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of the fore-side of their forgerie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in the sight of all men cleane disgraced,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To thinke with how great vaunt of braverie</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He them abused through his subtill slights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what a glorious shew he made in all their sights.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There leave we them in pleasure and repast,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with their might beat downe licentious lust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which proudly did impugne her sentence just:</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Remaines on earth, preserv’d from yron rust</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>Then this of Artegall, which here we have to say.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who having lately left that lovely payre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Enlincked fast in wedlockes loyall bond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bold Marinell with Florimell the fayre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With whom great feast and goodly glee he fond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Departed from the Castle of the Strond</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To follow his adventures first intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which long agoe he taken had in hond:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne wight with him for his assistance went,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that great yron groome, his gard and government.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With whom, as he did passe by the sea shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He chaunst to come whereas two comely Squires,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both brethren, whom one wombe together bore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But stirred up with different desires,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Together strove, and kindled wrathfull fires:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And them beside two seemely damzells stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By all meanes seeking to asswage their ires;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now with faire words, but words did little good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now with sharpe threats, but threats the more increast their mood.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And there before them stood a Coffer strong</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fast bound on every side with iron bands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But seeming to have suffred mickle wrong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Either by being wreckt uppon the sands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or being carried farre from forraine lands.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seem’d that for it these Squires at ods did fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And bent against them selves their cruell hands;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But evermore those Damzells did forestall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their furious encounter, and their fiercenesse pall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But firmely fixt they were with dint of sword</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And battailes doubtfull proofe their rights to try,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne other end their fury would afford,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But what to them Fortune would justify:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So stood they both in readinesse thereby</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To joyne the combate with cruell intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When Artegall, arriving happily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did stay a while their greedy bickerment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till he had questioned the cause of their dissent.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To whom the elder did this aunswere frame:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Then weete ye, Sir, that we two brethren be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom our sire, Milesio by name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did equally bequeath his lands in fee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Two Hands, which ye there before you see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not farre in sea; of which the one appeares</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But like a little Mount of small degree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet was as great and wide, ere many yeares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As that same other Isle, that greater bredth now beares.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But tract of time, that all things doth decay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this devouring Sea, that naught doth spare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The most part of my land hath washt away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And throwne it up unto my brothers share:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So his encreased, but mine did empaire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before which time I lov’d, as was my lot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That further mayd, hight Philtera the faire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With whom a goodly doure I should have got,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And should have joyned bene to her in wedlocks knot.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Then did my younger brother, Amidas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Love that same other Damzell, Lucy bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom but little dowre allotted was:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her vertue was the dowre that did delight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What better dowre can to a dame be hight?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But now, when Philtra saw my lands decay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And former livelod fayle, she left me quight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to my brother did ellope streight way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who, taking her from me, his owne love left astray.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“She, seeing then her selfe forsaken so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through dolorous despaire which she conceyved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the Sea her selfe did headlong throw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thinking to have her griefe by death bereaved:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But see how much her purpose was deceaved!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whilest thus, amidst the billowes beating of her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Twixt life and death long to and fro she weaved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She chaunst unwares to light uppon this coffer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which to her in that daunger hope of life did offer.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The wretched mayd, that earst desir’d to die,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When as the paine of death she tasted had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And but halfe scene his ugly visnomie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gan to repent that she had beene so mad</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For any death to chaunge life, though most bad:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And catching hold of this Sea-beaten chest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(The lucky Pylot of her passage sad,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After long tossing in the seas distrest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her weary barke at last uppon mine Isle did rest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Where I by chaunce then wandring on the shore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did her espy, and through my good endevour</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From dreadfull mouth of death, which threatned sore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her to have swallow’d up, did helpe to save her.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She then, in recompence of that great favour</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which I on her bestowed, bestowed on me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The portion of that good which Fortune gave her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Together with her selfe in dowry free;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both goodly portions, but of both the better she.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Yet in this coffer which she with her brought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Great threasure sithence we did finde contained,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which as our owne we tooke, and so it thought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But this same other Damzell since hath fained</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That to her selfe that threasure appertained;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that she did transport the same by sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To bring it to her husband new ordained,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But suffred cruell shipwracke by the way:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But whether it be so or no, I can not say.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But, whether it indeede be so or no,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This doe I say, that what so good or ill</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or God or Fortune unto me did throw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not wronging any other by my will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I hold mine owne, and so will hold it still.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And though my land he first did winne away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then my love, (though now it little skill)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet my good lucke he shall not likewise pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I will it defend whilst ever that I may.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So having sayd, the younger did ensew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Full true it is what so about our land</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My brother here declared hath to you:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But not for it this ods twixt us doth stand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But for this threasure throwne uppon his strand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which well I prove, as shall appeare by triall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be this maides with whom I fastned hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Known by good markes and perfect good espiall:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore it ought be rendred her without deniall.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When they thus ended had, the Knight began:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Certes, your strife were easie to accord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would ye remit it to some righteous man.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Unto yourselfe,” said they, “we give our word,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To bide that judgement ye shall us afford.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Then for assurance to my doome to stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under my foote let each lay downe his sword;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then you shall my sentence understand.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So each of them layd downe his sword out of his hand.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then Artegall thus to the younger sayd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Now tell me, Amidas, if that ye may,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Your brothers land the which the sea hath layd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto your part, and pluckt from his away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By what good right doe you withhold this day?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“What other right,” (quoth he) “should you esteeme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that the sea it to my share did lay?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Your right is good,” (sayd he) “and so I deeme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That what the sea unto you sent your own should seeme.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then turning to the elder thus he sayd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Now, Bracidas, let this likewise be showne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Your brothers threasure, which from him is strayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Being the dowry of his wife well knowne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By what right doe you claime to be your owne?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“What other right,” (quoth he) “should you esteeme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that the sea hath it unto me throwne?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Your right is good,” (sayd he) “and so I deeme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That what the sea unto you sent your own should seeme.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“For equall right in equall things doth stand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For what the mighty Sea hath once possest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And plucked quite from all possessors hand,</span>

					<span class="i1">Whether by rage of waves that never rest,</span>

					<span class="i1">Or else by wracke that wretches hath distrest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He may dispose by his imperiall might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As thing at randon left, to whom he list.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So, Amidas, the land was yours first hight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so the threasure yours is, Bracidas, by right.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When he his sentence thus pronounced had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both Amidas and Philtra were displeased;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Bracidas and Lucy were right glad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on the threasure by that judgement seased.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So was their discord by this doome appeased,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And each one had his right. Then Artegall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When as their sharpe contention he had ceased,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Departed on his way, as did befall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To follow his old quest, the which him forth did call.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So as he travelled uppon the way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He chaunst to come, where happily he spide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A rout of many people farre away;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom his course he hastily applide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To weete the cause of their assemblaunce wide:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom when he approched neare in sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(An uncouth sight) he plainely then descride</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be a troupe of women, warlike dight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With weapons in their hands as ready for to fight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And in the midst of them he saw a Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With both his hands behinde him pinnoed hard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And round about his necke an halter tight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ready for the gallow-tree prepard:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His face was covered, and his head was bar’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That who he was uneath was to descry;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with full heavy heart with them he far’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Griev’d to the soule, and groning inwardly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he of womens hands so base a death should dy.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But they, like tyrants mercilesse, the more</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rejoyced at his miserable case,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And him reviled, and reproched sore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With bitter taunts and termes of vile disgrace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now when as Artegall, arriv’d in place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did aske what cause brought that man to decay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They round about him gan to swarme apace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Meaning on him their cruell hands to lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to have wrought unwares some villanous assay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But he was soone aware of their ill minde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And drawing backe deceived their intent:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet, though him selfe did shame on womankinde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His mighty hand to shend, he Talus sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To wrecke on them their follies hardyment:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who with few sowces of his yron flale</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dispersed all their troupe incontinent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sent them home to tell a piteous tale</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of their vaine prowesse turned to their proper bale.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But that same wretched man, ordayned to die,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They left behind them, glad to be so quit:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him Talus tooke out of perplexitie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And horrour of fowle death for Knight unfit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who more then losse of life ydreaded it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, him restoring unto living light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So brought unto his Lord, where he did sit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beholding all that womanish weake fight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whom soone as he beheld he knew, and thus behight</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Sir Turpine! haplesse man, what make you here?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or have you lost your selfe and your discretion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ever in this wretched case ye were?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or have ye yeelded you to proude oppression</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of womens powre, that boast of mens subjection?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or else what other deadly dismall day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is falne on you by heavens hard direction</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ye were runne so fondly far astray</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As for to lead your selfe unto your owne decay?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Much was the man confounded in his mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Partly with shame, and partly with dismay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all astonisht he him selfe did find,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And little had for his excuse to say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But onely thus: “Most haplesse well ye may</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Me justly terme, that to this shame am brought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And made the scorne of Knighthod this same day:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But who can scape what his owne fate hath wrought?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The worke of heavens will surpasseth humaine thought.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Right true: but faulty men use oftentimes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To attribute their folly unto fate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And lay on heaven the guilt of their owne crimes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But tell, Sir Terpin, ne let you amate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Your misery, how fell ye in this state?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Then sith ye needs” (quoth he) “will know my shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the ill which chaunst to me of late,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I shortly will to you rehearse the same,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In hope ye will not turne misfortune to my blame.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Being desirous (as all Knights are woont)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through hard adventures deedes of armes to try,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And after fame and honour for to hunt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I heard report that farre abrode did fly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That a proud Amazon did late defy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All the brave Knights that hold of Maidenhead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And unto them wrought all the villany</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That she could forge in her malicious head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which some hath put to shame, and many done be dead.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The cause, they say, of this her cruell hate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is for the sake of Bellodant the bold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom she bore most fervent love of late,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wooed him by all the waies she could:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when she saw at last that he ne would</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For ought or nought be wonne unto her will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She turn’d her love to hatred manifold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And for his sake vow’d to doe all the ill</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which she could doe to Knights; which now she doth fulfill.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“For all those Knights, the which by force or guile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She doth subdue, she fowly doth entreate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">First, she doth them of warlike armes despoile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And cloth in womens weedes: And then with threat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth them compell to worke, to earne their meat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To spin, to card, to sew, to wash, to wring;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne doth she give them other thing to eat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But bread and water or like feeble thing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Them to disable from revenge adventuring.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But if through stout disdaine of manly mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Any her proud observaunce will withstand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uppon that gibbet, which is there behind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She causeth them be hang’d up out of hand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which condition I right now did stand:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For, being overcome by her in fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And put to that base service of her band,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I rather chose to die in lives despight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then lead that shamefull life, unworthy of a Knight.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“How hight that Amazon?” (said Artegall)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“And where and how far hence does she abide?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Her name” (quoth he) “they Radigund doe call,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A Princesse of great powre and greater pride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Queene of Amazons, in armes well tride</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sundry battels, which she hath atchieved</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With great successe, that her hath glorifide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And made her famous, more then is believed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne would I it have ween’d, had I not late it prieved.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Now sure,” (said he) “and by the faith that I</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To Maydenhead and noble knighthood owe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I will not rest till I her might doe trie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And venge the shame that she to Knights doth show.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore, Sir Terpin, from you lightly throw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This squalid weede, the patterne of dispaire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wend with me, that ye may see and know</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How Fortune will your ruin’d name repaire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And knights of Maidenhead, whose praise she would empaire.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that, like one that hopelesse was depryv’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From deathes dore at which he lately lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those yron fetters wherewith he was gyv’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The badges of reproch, he threw away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And nimbly did him dight to guide the way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the dwelling of that Amazone:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which was from thence not past a mile or tway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A goodly citty and a mighty one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The which, of her owne name, she called Radegone.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Where they arriving by the watchman were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Descried streight; who all the city warned</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How that three warlike persons did appeare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which the one him seem’d a Knight all armed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And th’other two well likely to have harmed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eftsoones the people all to harnesse ran,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And like a sort of Bees in clusters swarmed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere long their Queene her selfe, halfe like a man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came forth into the rout, and them t’array began.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And now the Knights, being arrived neare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did beat uppon the gates to enter in;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And at the Porter, skorning them so few,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Threw many threats, if they the towne did win,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To teare his flesh in peeces for his sin:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which when as Radigund there comming heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her heart for rage did grate, and teeth did grin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She bad that streight the gates should be unbard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to them way to make with weapons well prepard.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Soone as the gates were open to them set,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They pressed forward, entraunce to have made;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But in the middle way they were ymet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With a sharpe showre of arrowes, which them staid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And better bad advise, ere they assaid</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unknowen perill of bold womens pride.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then all that rout uppon them rudely laid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And heaped strokes so fast on every side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And arrowes haild so thicke, that they could not abide.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Radigund her selfe, when she espide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sir Terpin, from her direfull doome acquit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So cruell doale amongst her maides divide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">T’avenge that shame they did on him commit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All sodainely enflam’d with furious fit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like a fell Lionesse at him she flew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on his head-peece him so fiercely smit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That to the ground him quite she overthrew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dismayd so with the stroke that he no colours knew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Soone as she saw him on the ground to grovell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She lightly to him leapt; and in his necke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her proud foote setting, at his head did levell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Weening at once her wrath on him to wreake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And his contempt, that did her judg’ment breake.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As when a Beare hath seiz’d her cruell clawes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uppon the carkasse of some beast too weake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Proudly stands over, and a while doth pause</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To heare the piteous beast pleading her plaintiffe cause.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whom when as Artegall in that distresse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By chaunce beheld, he left the bloudy slaughter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which he swam, and ranne to his redresse:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There her assayling fiercely fresh, he raught her</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such an huge stroke, that it of sence distraught her;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And had she not it warded warily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It had depriv’d her mother of a daughter:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nathlesse for all the powre she did apply</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It made her stagger oft, and stare with ghastly eye.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like to an Eagle, in his kingly pride</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Soring through his wide Empire of the aire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To weather his brode sailes, by chaunce hath spide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A Goshauke, which hath seized for her share</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uppon some fowle that should her feast prepare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With dreadfull force he flies at her bylive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with his souce, which none enduren dare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her from the quarrey he away doth drive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And from her griping pounce the greedy prey doth rive.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, soone as she her sence recover’d had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She fiercely towards him her selfe gan dight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through vengeful wrath and sdeignfull pride half mad;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For never had she suffred such despight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But ere she could joyne hand with him to fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her warlike maides about her flockt so fast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That they disparted them, maugre their might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with their troupes did far asunder cast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But mongst the rest the fight did untill evening last.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And every while that mighty yron man</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With his strange weapon, never wont in warre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Them sorely vext, and courst, and overran,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And broke their bowes, and did their shooting marre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That none of all the many once did darre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him to assault, nor once approach him nie;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But like a sort of sheepe dispersed farre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For dread of their devouring enemie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through all the fields and vallies did before him flie.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But when as dales faire shinie-beame, yclowded</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With fearefull shadowes of deformed night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Warn’d man and beast in quiet rest be shrowded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bold Radigund with sound of trumpe on hight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Causd all her people to surcease from fight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gathering them unto her citties gate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made them all enter in before her sight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the wounded, and the weake in state,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be convayed in, ere she would once retrate.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When thus the field was voided all away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all things quieted, the Elfin Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Weary of toile and travell of that day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Causd his pavilion to be richly pight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before the city gate, in open sight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where he him selfe did rest in safety</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Together with Sir Terpin all that night:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Talus usde, in times of jeopardy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To keepe a nightly watch for dread of treachery.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Radigund, full of heart-gnawing griefe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the rebuke which she sustain’d that day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could take no rest, ne would receive reliefe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But tossed in her troublous minde what way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She mote revenge that blot which on her lay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There she resolv’d her selfe in single fight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To try her Fortune, and his force assay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rather then see her people spoiled quight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As she had scene that day, a disaventerous sight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She called forth to her a trusty mayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom she thought fittest for that businesse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her name was Clarin, and thus to her sayd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Goe, damzell, quickly, doe thy selfe addresse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To doe the message which I shall expresse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Goe thou unto that stranger Faery Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who yeester day drove us to such distresse:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tell, that to morrow I with him wil fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And try in equall field whether hath greater might.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But these conditions doe to him propound:</span>
					<br/>

					<span class="i1">What ever he shall like to doe or say.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Goe streight, and take with thee to witnesse it</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And beare with you both wine and juncates fit,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Damzell streight obayd, and putting all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In readinesse, forth to the Towne-gate went;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where, sounding loud a Trumpet from the wall,</span>

					<span class="i1">Unto those warlike Knights she warning sent.</span>

					<span class="i1">Then Talus forth issuing from the tent</span>

					<span class="i1">To weeten what that trumpets sounding ment:</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So he them streight conduaed to his Lord;</span>

					<span>All in a Camis light of purple silke</span>

					<span class="i1">Woven uppon with silver, subtly wrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And quilted uppon sattin white as milke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Trayled with ribbands diversly distraught,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like as the workeman had their courses taught;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which was short tucked for light motion</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Downe to her lowest heele; and thereuppon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She wore for her defence a mayled habergeon.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And on her legs she painted buskins wore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Basted with bends of gold on every side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And mailes betweene, and laced close afore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uppon her thigh her Cemitare was tide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With an embrodered belt of mickell pride;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on her shoulder hung her shield, bedeckt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uppon the bosse with stones that shined wide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As the faire Moone in her most full aspect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That to the Moone it mote be like in each respect:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So forth she came out of the citty gate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With stately port and proud magnificence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Guarded with many Damzels that diu waite</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uppon her person for her sure defence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Playing on shaumes and trumpets, that from hence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their sound did reach unto the heavens hight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So forth into the field she marched thence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where was a rich Pavilion ready pight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her to receive, till time they should begin the fight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then forth came Artegall out of his tent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All arm’d to point, and first the Lists did enter:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Soone after eke came she, with fell intent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And countenaunce fierce, as having fully bent her</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That battells utmost triall to adventer.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Lists were closed fast, to barrc the rout</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From rudely pressing to the middle center;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which in great heapes them circled all about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wayting how Fortune would resolve that daungerous dout.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Trumpets sounded, and the field began;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With bitter strokes it both began and ended.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She at the first encounter on him ran</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With furious rage, as if she had intended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of his breast the very heart have rended:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he, that had like tempests often tride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From that first flaw him selfe right well defended.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The more she rag’d, the more he did abide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She hewd, she foynd, she lasht, she laid on every side.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet still her blowes he bore, and her forbore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Weening at last to win advantage new;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet still her crueltie increased more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, though powre faild, her courage did accrew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which fayling, he gan fiercely her pursew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like as a Smith that to his cunning feat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The stubborne mettall seeketh to subdew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Soone as he feeles it mollifide with heat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With his great yron sledge doth strongly on it beat.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So did Sir Artegall upon her lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if she had an yron andvile beene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That flakes of fire, bright as the sunny ray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of her steely armes were flashing scene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all on fire ye would her surely weene;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But with her shield so well her selfe she warded</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the dread daunger of his weapon keene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all that while her life she safely garded;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he that helpe from her against her will discarded.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For with his trenchant blade at the next blow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Halfe of her shield he shared quite away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That halfe her side it selfe did naked show,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thenceforth unto daunger opened way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Much was she moved with the mightie sway</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that sad stroke, that halfe enrag’d she grew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, like a greedie Beare unto her pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With her sharpe Cemitare at him she flew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That glauncing downe his thigh the purple bloud forth drew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thereat she gan to triumph with great boast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to upbrayd that chaunce which him misfell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if the prize she gotten had almost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With spightfull speaches, fitting with her well;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That his great hart gan inwardly to swell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With indignation at her vaunting vaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And at her strooke with puissaunce fearefull fell:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet with her shield she warded it againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That shattered all to peeces round about the plaine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Having her thus disarmed of her shield,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon her helmet he againe her strooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That downe she fell upon the grassie field</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In sencelesse swoune, as if her life forsooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And pangs of death her spirit overtooke.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom when he saw before his foote prostrated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He to her lept with deadly dreadfull looke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And her sunshynie helmet soone unlaced,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thinking at once both head and helmet to have raced.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, when as he discovered had her face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He saw, his senses straunge astonishment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A miracle of natures goodly grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In her faire visage voide of ornament,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But bath’d in bloud and sweat together ment;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which in the rudenesse of that evill plight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bewrayd the signes of feature excellent:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like as the Moone in foggie winters night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Doth seeme to be her selfe, though darkned be her light.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At sight thereof his cruell minded hart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Empierced was with pittifull regard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That his sharpe sword he threw from him apart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cursing his hand that had that visage mard:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No hand so cruell, nor no hart so hard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But ruth of beautie will it mollifie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By this, upstarting from her swoune, she star’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A while about her with confused eye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like one that from his dreame is waked suddenlye.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Soone as the knight she there by her did spy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Standing with emptie hands all weaponlesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With fresh assault upon him she did fly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gan renew her former cruelnesse:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And though he still retyr’d, yet nathelesse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With huge redoubled strokes she on him layd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more increast her outrage mercilesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The more that he with meeke intreatie prayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her wrathful hand from greedy vengeance to have stayd,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like as a Puttocke having spyde in sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A gentle Faulcon sitting on an hill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose other wing, now made unmeete for flight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was lately broken by some fortune ill;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The foolish Kyte, led with licentious will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth beat upon the gentle bird in vaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With many idle stoups her troubling still:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even so did Radigund with bootlesse paine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Annoy this noble Knight, and sorely him constraine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nought could he do but shun the dred despight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of her fierce wrath, and backward still retyre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with his single shield, well as he might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beare off the burden of her raging yre:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And evermore he gently did desyre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To stay Her stroks, and he himselfe would yield;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet nould she hearke, ne let him once respyre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till he to her delivered had his shield,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to her mercie him submitted in plaine field.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So was he overcome; not overcome,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But to her yeelded of his owne accord;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet was he justly damned by the doome</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his owne mouth, that spake so warelesse word,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be her thrall and service her afford:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For though that he first victorie obtayned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet after, by abandoning his sword,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He wilfull lost that he before attayned:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No fayrer conquest then that with goodwill is gayned.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tho with her sword on him she flatling strooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In signe of true subjection to her powre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And as her vassall him to thraldome tooke:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Terpine, borne to’ a more unhappy howre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he on whom the lucklesse stars did lowre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She caused to be attacht, and forthwith led</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the crooke, t’abide the balefull stowre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From which he lately had through reskew fled:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where he full shamefully was hanged by the hed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But when they thought on Talus hands to lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He with his yron flaile amongst them thondred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That they were fayne to let him scape away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Glad from his companie to be so sondred;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose presence all their troups so much encombred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That th’ heapes of those which he did wound and slay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Besides the rest dismayd, might not be nombred:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet all that while he would not once assay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To reskew his owne Lord, but thought it just t’obay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then tooke the Amazon this noble knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Left to her will by his owne wilfull blame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And caused him to be disarmed quight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all the ornaments of knightly name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which whylome he gotten had great fame:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Instead whereof she made him to be dight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In womans weedes, that is to manhood shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And put before his lap a napron white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Instead of Curiets and bases fit for fight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So being clad she brought him from the field,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which he had bene trayned many a day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into a long large chamber, which was sield</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With moniments of many Knights decay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By her subdewed in victorious fray:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Amongst the which she causd his warlike armes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be hang’d on high, that mote his shame bewray;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And broke his sword, for feare of further harmes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With which he wont to stirre up battailous alarmes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There entred in he round about him saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Many brave knights, whose names right well he knew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There bound t’obay that Amazons proud law,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Spinning and carding all in comely rew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That his bigge hart loth’d so uncomely vew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But they were forst, through penurie and pyne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To doe those workes to them appointed dew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For nought was given them to sup or dyne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But what their hands could earne by twisting linnen twyne.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Amongst them all she placed him most low,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in his hand a distaffe to him gave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he thereon should spin both flax and tow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A sordid office for a mind so brave:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So hard it is to be a womans slave.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet he it tooke in his owne selfes despight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thereto did himselfe right well behave</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her to obay, sith he his faith had plight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her vassall to become, if she him wonne in fight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who had him scene imagine mote thereby</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That whylome hath of Hercules bene told,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How for lolas sake he did apply</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His mightie hands the distaffe vile to hold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For his huge club, which had subdew’d of old</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So many monsters which the world annoyed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His Lyons skin chaungd to a pall of gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which, forgetting warres, he onely joyed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In combats of sweet love, and with his mistresse toyed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Such is the crueltie of womenkynd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When they have shaken off the shamefast band,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which wise Nature did them strongly bynd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">T’obay the heasts of mans well-ruling hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That then all rule and reason they withstand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To purchase a licentious libertie:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But vertuous women wisely understand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That they were borne to base humilitie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unlesse the heavens them lift to lawfull soveraintie.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus there long while continu’d Artegall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Serving proud Radigund with true subjection,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How ever it his noble heart did gall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">T’obay a womans tyrannous direction,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That might have had of life or death election:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, having chosen, now he might not chaunge.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">During which time the warlike Amazon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose wandring fancie after lust did raunge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gan cast a secret liking to this captive straunge.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which long concealing in her covert brest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She chaw’d the cud of lovers carefull plight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet could it not so thoroughly digest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Being fast fixed in her wounded spright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But it tormented her both day and night:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet would she not thereto yeeld free accord</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To serve the lowly vassall of her might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of her servant make her soverayne Lord:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So great her pride that she such basenesse much abhord.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So much the greater still her anguish grew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through stubborne handling of her love-sicke hart;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And still the more she strove it to subdew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The more she still augmented her owne smart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wyder made the wound of th’ hidden dart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At last, when long she struggled had in vaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She gan to stoupe, and her proud mind convert</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To meeke obeysance of loves mightie raine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And him entreat for grace that had procur’d her paine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Unto her selfe in secret she did call</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her nearest handmayd, whom she most did trust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to her said: “Clarinda, whom of all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I trust alive, sith I thee fostred first,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now is the time that I untimely must</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereof make tryall in my greatest need.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It is so hapned that the heavens unjust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Spighting my happie freedome, have agreed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To thrall my looser life, or my last bale to breed.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that she turn’d her head, as halfe abashed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To hide the blush which in her visage rose</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And through her eyes like sudden lightning flashed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Decking her cheeke with a vermilion rose;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But soone she did her countenance compose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to her turning thus began againe:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“This griefes deepe wound I would to thee disclose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereto compelled through hart-murdring paine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But dread of shame my doubtfull lips doth still restraine.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Ah! my deare dread,” (said then the faithfull Mayd)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Can dread of ought your dreadlesse hart withhold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That many hath with dread of death dismayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And dare even deathes most dreadfull face behold?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Say on, my soverayne Ladie, and be bold:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth not your handmayds life at your foot lie?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therewith much comforted she gan unfold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The cause of her conceived maladie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As one that would confesse, yet faine would it denie.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Clarin,” (said she) “thou seest yond Fayry Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom not my valour, but his owne brave mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Subjected hath to my unequall might.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What right is it, that he should thraldome find</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For lending life to me, a wretch unkind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That for such good him recompence with ill?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore I cast how I may him unbind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by his freedome get his free goodwill;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet so, as bound to me he may continue still:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Bound unto me but not with such hard bands</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of strong compulsion and streight violence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As now in miserable state he stands;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But with sweet love and sure benevolence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Voide of malitious mind or foule offence:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which if thou canst win him any way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without discoverie of my thoughts pretence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both goodly meede of him it purchase may,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke with gratefull service me right well apay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Which that thou mayst the better bring to pas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Loe! here this ring, which shall thy warrant bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And token true to old Eumenias,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From time to time, when thou it best shah see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in and out thou mayst have passage free.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Goe now, Clarinda; well thy wits advise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all thy forces gather unto thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Armies of lovely lookes, and speeches wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With which thou canst even Jove himselfe to love entise.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The trustie Mayd, conceiving her intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did with sure promise of her good endevour</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Give her great comfort and some harts content.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So, from her parting, she thenceforth did labour</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By all the meanes she might to curry favour</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With th’ Elfin Knight, her Ladies best beloved:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With daily shew of courteous kind behaviour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even at the marke-white of his hart she roved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with wide-glauncing words one day she thus him proved.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Unhappie Knight! upon whose hopelesse state</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fortune, envying good, hath felly frowned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And cruell heavens have heapt an heavy fate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I rew that thus thy better dayes are drowned</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In sad despaire, and all thy senses swowned</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In stupid sorow, sith thy juster merit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Might else have with felicitie bene crowned:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Looke up at last, and wake thy dulled spirit</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To thinke how this long death thou mightest disinherit.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Much did he marvell at her uncouth speach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose hidden drift he could not well perceive;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gan to doubt least she him sought t’appeach</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of treason, or some guilefull traine did weave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through which she might his wretched life bereave.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both which to barre he with this answere met her:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Faire Damzell, that with ruth (as I perceave)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of my mishaps art mov’d to wish me better,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For such your kind regard I can but rest your detter.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Yet, weet ye well, that to a courage great</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It is no lesse beseeming well to beare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The storme of fortunes frowne or heavens threat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then in the sunshine of her countenance cleare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Timely to joy and carrie comely cheare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For though this cloud have now me overcast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet doe I not of better times despeyre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And though (unlike) they should for ever last,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet in my truthes assurance I rest fixed fast.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But what so stonie minde,” (she then replyde)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“But if in his owne powre occasion lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would to his hope a windowe open wyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to his fortunes helpe make readie way?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Unworthy sure” (quoth he) “of better day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That will not take the offer of good hope,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke pursew, if he attaine it may.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which speaches she applying to the scope</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of her intent, this further purpose to him shope.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Then why doest not, thou ill advized man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make meanes to win thy libertie forlorne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And try if thou by faire entreatie can</span>

					<span class="i1">Of Beares and Tygres, nor so salvage mynded</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As that, albe all love of men she scorne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She yet forgets that she of men was kynded:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sooth oft scene, that proudest harts base love hath blynded.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Certes, Clarinda, not of cancred will,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(Sayd he) “nor obstinate disdainefull mind,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But want of meanes hath bene mine onely let</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From seeking favour where it doth abound;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which if I might by your good office get,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I to your selfe should rest for ever bound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And readie to deserve what grace I found.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She feeling him thus bite upon the bayt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet doubting least his hold was but unsound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And not well fastened, would not strike him strayt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But drew him on with hope fit leasure to awayt.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, foolish Mayd! whyles heedlesse of the hooke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She thus oft times was beating off and on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through slipperie footing fell into the brooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And there was caught to her confusion:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For, seeking thus to salve the Amazon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She wounded was with her deceipts owne dart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gan thenceforth to cast affection,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Conceived close in her beguiled hart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Artegall, through pittie of his causelesse smart.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet durst she not disclose her fancies wound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne to himselfe, for doubt of being sdayned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne yet to any other wight on ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For feare her mistresse shold have knowledge gayned;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But to her selfe it secretly retayned</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within the closet of her covert brest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The more thereby her tender hart was payned;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet to awayt fit time she weened best,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fairely did dissemble her sad thoughts unrest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One day her Ladle, calling her apart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gan to demaund of her some tydings good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Touching her loves successe, her lingring smart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therewith she gan at first to change her mood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As one adaw’d, and halfe confused stood;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But quickly she it overpast, so soone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As she her face had wypt to fresh her blood:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tho gan she tell her all that she had donne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the wayes she sought his love for to have wonne</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But sayd that he was obstinate and sterne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Scorning her offers and conditions vaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne would be taught with any termes to lerne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So fond a lesson as to love againe:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Die rather would he in penurious paine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And his abridged dayes in dolour wast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then his foes love or liking entertaine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His resolution was, both first and last,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His bodie was her thrall, his hart was freely plast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when the cruell Amazon perceived,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She gan to storme, and rage, and rend her gall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For very fell despight which she conceived,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be so scorned of a base-borne thrall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose life did lie in her least eye-lids fall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which she vow’d, with many a cursed threat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That she therefore would him ere long forstall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nathlesse, when calmed was her furious heat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She chang’d that threatfull mood, and mildly gan entreat</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“What now is left, Clarinda? what remaines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That we may compasse this our enterprize?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Great shame to lose so long employed paines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And greater shame t’abide so great misprize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which he dares our offers thus despize:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet that his guilt the greater may appeare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more my gratious mercie by this wize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I will a while with his first folly beare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till thou have tride againe, and tempted him more neare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Say and do all that may thereto prevaile;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Leave nought unpromist that may him perswade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Life, freedome, grace, and gifts of great availe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which the Gods themselves are mylder made:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereto adde art, even womens witty trade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The art of mightie words that men can charme;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which in case thou canst him not invade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let him feele hardnesse of thy heavie arme:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who will not stoupe with good shall be made stoupe with harme.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Some of his diet doe from him withdraw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For I him find to be too proudly fed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Give him more labour, and with streighter law,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he with worke may be forwearied:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let him lodge hard, and lie in strawen bed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That may pull downe the courage of his pride;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And lay upon him, for his greater dread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cold yron chaines with which let him be tide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And let what ever he desires be him denide.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“When thou hast all this doen, then bring me newes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his demeane: thenceforth not like a lover,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But like a rebell stout, I will him use;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For I resolve this siege not to give over,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till I the conquest of my will recover.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So she departed full of griefe and sdaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which inly did to great impatience move her:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But the false mayden shortly turn’d againe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the prison, where her hart did thrall remaine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There all her subtill nets she did unfold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the engins of her wit display;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which she meant him warelesse to enfold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of his innocence to make her pray.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So cunningly she wrought her crafts assay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That both her Ladie, and her selfe withall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke the knight attonce she did betray;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But most the knight, whom she with guilefull call</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did cast for to allure into her trap to fall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As a bad Nurse, which, fayning to receive</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In her owne mouth the food ment for her chyld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Withholdes it to her selfe, and doeth deceive</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The infant, so for want of nourture spoyld;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even so Clarinda her owne Dame beguyld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And turn’d the trust which was in her affyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To feeding of her private fire, which boyld</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her inward brest, and in her entrayles fryde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The more that she it sought to cover and to hyde.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For, comming to this knight, she purpose fayned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How earnest suit she earst for him had made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto her Queene, his freedome to have gayned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But by no meanes could her thereto perswade;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that instead thereof she sternely bade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His miserie to be augmented more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And many yron bands on him to lade:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All which nathlesse she for his love forebore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So praying him t’accept her service evermore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And, more then that, she promist that she would,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In case she might finde favour in his eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Devize how to enlarge him out of hould.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Fayrie, glad to gaine his libertie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Can yeeld great thankes for such her curtesie;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with faire words, fit for the time and place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To feede the humour of her maladie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Promist, if she would free him from that case,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He wold, by all good means he might, deserve such grace.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So daily he faire semblant did her shew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet never meant he in his noble mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To his owne absent love to be untrew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ever did deceiptfull Clarin find</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In her false hart his bondage to unbind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But rather how she mote him faster tye.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore unto her mistresse most unkind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She daily told her love he did defye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And him she told her Dame his freedome did denye.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet thus much friendship she to him did show,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That his scarse diet somewhat was amended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And his worke lessened, that his love mote grow:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet to her Dame him still she discommended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That she with him mote be the more offended.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus he long while in thraldome there remayned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of both beloved well, but litle frended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Untill his owne true love his freedome gayned:</span>

					<span class="i1">That notwithstanding all the subtill bait</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which those Amazons his love still craved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To his owne love his loialtie he saved:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose character in th’Adamantine mould</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his true hart so firmely was engraved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That no new loves impression ever could</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bereave it thence: such blot his honour blemish should.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet his owne love, the noble Britomart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Scarse so conceived in her jealous thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What time sad tydings of his balefull smart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In womans bondage Talus to her brought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Brought in untimely houre, ere it was sought:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For, after that the utmost date assynde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For his returne she waited had for nought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She gan to cast in her misdoubtfull mynde</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thousand feares, that love-sicke fancies faine to fynde.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sometime she feared least some hard mishap</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had him misfalne in his adventurous quest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sometime least his false foe did him entrap</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In traytrous traine, or had unwares opprest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But most she did her troubled mynd molest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And secretly afflict with jealous feare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Least some new love had him from her possest:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet loth she was, since she no ill did heare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To thinke of him so ill; yet could she not forbeare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One while she blam’d her selfe; another whyle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She him condemn’d as trustlesse and untrew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then, her griefe with errour to beguyle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She fayn’d to count the time againe anew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if before she had not counted trew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For houres, but daycs; for weekes that passed were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She told but moneths, to make them seeme more few;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet when she reckned them, still drawing nearc,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each hour did seeme a moneth, and every moneth a yeare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But when as yet she saw him not returne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She thought to send some one to seeke him out;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But none she found so fit to serve that turne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As her owne selfe, to ease her selfe of dout.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now she deviz’d, amongst the warlike rout</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of errant Knights, to seeke her errant Knight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then againe resolv’d to hunt him out</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Amongst loose Ladies lapped in delight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then both Knights envide, and Ladies eke did spight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One day when as she long had sought for ease</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In every place, and every place thought best,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet found no place that could her liking please,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She to a window came that opened West,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Towards which coast her love his way addrest:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There looking forth, shee in her heart did find</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Many vaine fancies working her unrest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sent her winged thoughts, more swift then wind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To beare unto her love the message of her mind.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There as she looked long, at last she spide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One comming towards her with hasty speede.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well weend she then, ere him she plaine descride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it was one sent from her love indeede;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who when he nigh approcht, shee mote arede</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it was Talus, Artegall his groome:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat her heart was fild with hope and drede;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne would she stay till he in place could come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But ran to meete him forth to know his tidings somme.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Even in the done him meeting, she begun:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“And where is he thy Lord, and how far hence?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Declare at once: and hath he lost or wun?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The yron man, albe he wanted sence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sorrowes feeling, yet, with conscience</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his ill newes, did inly chill and quake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And stood still mute, as one in great suspence;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if that by his silence he would make</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her rather reade his meaning then him selfe it spake.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Till she againe thus sayd: “Talus, be bold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And tell what ever it be, good or bad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That from thy tongue thy hearts intent doth hold.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom he thus at length: “The tidings sad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I would hide, will needs, I see, be rad.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Lord, your love, by hard mishap doth lie</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In wretched bondage, wofully bestad.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Ay me,” (quoth she) “what wicked destinie!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And is he vanquisht by his tyrant enemy?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Not by that Tyrant, his intended foe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But by a Tyrantesse,” (he then replide)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“That him captived hath in haplesse woe.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Cease, thou bad newes-man! badly doest thou hide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy maisters shame, in harlots bondage tide:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The rest my selfe too readily can spell.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With that in rage she turn’d from him aside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forcing in vaine the rest to her to tell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to her chamber went like solitary cell.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There she began to make her monefull plaint</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against her Knight for being so untrew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And him to touch with falshoods fowle attaint,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all his other honour overthrew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Oft did she blame her selfe, and often rew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For yeelding to a straungers love so light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose life and manners straunge she never knew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And evermore she did him sharpely twight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For breach of faith to her, which he had firmely plight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And then she in her wrathfull will did cast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How to revenge that blot of honour blent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To fight with him, and goodly die her last:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then againe she did her selfe torment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Inflidting on her selfe his punishment.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A while she walkt, and chauft; a while she threw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her selfe uppon her bed, and did lament:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet did she not lament with loude alew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As women wont, but with deepe sighes and singults few.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like as a wayward childe, whose sounder sleepe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is broken with some fearefull dreames affright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With froward will doth set him selfe to weepe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne can be stild for all his nurses might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But kicks, and squals, and shriekes for fell despight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now scratching her, and her loose locks misusing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now seeking darkenesse, and now seeking light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then craving sucke, and then the sucke refusing:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such was this Ladies fit in her loves fond accusing.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But when she had with such unquiet fits</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her selfe there close afflicted long in vaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet found no easement in her troubled wits,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She unto Talus forth return’d againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By change of place seeking to ease her paine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gan enquire of him with mylder mood</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The certaine cause of Artegals detaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And what he did, and in what state he stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And whether he did woo, or whether he were woo’d?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Ah wellaway!” (sayd then the yron man)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“That he is not the while in state to woo;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But lies in wretched thraldome, weake and wan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not by strong hand compelled thereunto,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But his owne doome, that none can now undoo.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Sayd I not then” (quoth shee), “erwhile aright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That this is things compare betwixt you two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Me to deceive of faith unto me plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since that he was not forst, nor overcome in fight?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that he gan at large to her dilate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whole discourse of his captivance sad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In sort as ye have heard the same of late:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All which when she with hard enduraunce had</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Heard to the end, she was right sore bestad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With sodaine stounds of wrath and griefe attone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne would abide, till she had aunswere made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But streight her selfe did dight, and armor don,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And mounting to her steede bad Talus guide her on.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So forth she rode uppon her ready way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To seeke her Knight, as Talus her did guide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sadly she rode, and never word did say</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor good nor bad, ne ever lookt aside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But still right downe; and in her thought did hide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The felnesse of her heart, right fully bent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To fierce avengement of that womans pride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which had her Lord in her base prison pent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so great honour with so fowle reproch had blent.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So as she thus melancholicke did ride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Chawing the cud of griefe and inward paine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She chaunst to meete, toward the even-tide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A Knight that softly paced on the plaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if him selfe to solace he were faine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well shot in yeares he seem’d, and rather bent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To peace then needlesse trouble to constraine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As well by view of that his vestiment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As by his modest semblant that no evill ment.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He comming neare gan gently her salute</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With curteous words, in the most comely wize;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who though desirous rather to rest mute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then termes to entertaine of common guize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet rather then she kindnesse would despize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She would her selfe displease; so him requite.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then gan the other further to devize</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of things abrode, as next to hand did light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And many things demaund, to which she answer’d light.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For little lust had she to talkc of ought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or ought to heare that mote delightfull bee:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her minde was whole possessed of one thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That gave none other place. Which when as hee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By outward signes (as well he might) did see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He list no lenger to use lothfull speach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But her besought to take it well in gree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sith shady dampe had dimd the heavens reach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To lodge with him that night, unles good cause empeach.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Championesse, now seeing night at dore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was glad to yeeld unto his good request,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with him went without gaine-saying more.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not farre away, but little wide by West,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His dwelling was, to which he him addrest:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where soone arriving they received were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In seemely wise, as them beseemed best;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For he, their host, them goodly well did chearc,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And talk’t of pleasant things the night away to weare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus passing th’evening well, till time of rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then Britomart unto a bowre was brought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where groomes awayted her to have undrest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But she ne would undressed be for ought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne doffe her armes, though he her much besought:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For she had vow’d, she sayd, not to forgo</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those warlike weedes, till she revenge had wrought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of a late wrong uppon a mortall foe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which she would sure performe, betide her wele or wo.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when their Host perceiv’d, right discontent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In minde he grew, for feare least by that art</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He should his purpose misse, which close he ment:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet taking leave of her he did depart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There all that night remained Britomart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Restlesse, recomfortlesse, with heart deepe grieved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor suffering the least twinckling sleepe to start</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into her eye, which th’ heart mote have relieved;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if the least appear’d, her eyes she streight reprieved:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Ye guilty eyes,” (sayd she) “the which with guyle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My heart at first betrayd, will ye betray</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My life now too, for which a little whyle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ye will not watch? false watches, wellaway!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I wote when ye did watch both night and day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto your losse; and now needes will ye sleepe?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now ye have made my heart to wake alway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now will ye sleepe? ah! wake, and rather weepe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To thinke of your night’s want, that should yee waking keepe.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus did she watch, and weare the weary night</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In waylfull plaints that none was to appease;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now walking soft, now sitting still upright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As sundry chaunge her seemed best to ease.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne lesse did Talus suffer sleepe to seaze</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His eye-lids sad, but watcht continually,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lying without her dore in great disease:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like to a Spaniell wayting carefully</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Least any should betray his Lady treacherously.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What time the native Belman of the night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The bird that warned Peter of his fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">First rings his silver Bell t’each sleepy wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That should their mindes up to devotion call,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She heard a wondrous noise below the hall:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All sodainely the bed, where she should lie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By a false trap was let adowne to fall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into a lower roome, and by and by</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The loft was raysd againe, that no man could it spie.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With sight whereof she was dismayd right sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perceiving well the treason which was ment;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet stirred not at all for doubt of more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But kept her place with courage confident,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wayting what would ensue of that event.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It was not long before she heard the sound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of armed men comming with close intent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Towards her chamber; at which dreadfull stound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She quickly caught her sword, and shield about her bound,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that there came unto her chamber dore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Two Knights all armed ready for to fight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And after them full many other more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A raskall rout, with weapons rudely dight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom soone as Talus spide by glims of night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He started up, there where on ground he lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in his hand his thresher ready keight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They seeing that let drive at him streightway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And round about him preace in riotous aray.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, soone as he began to lay about</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With his rude yron flaile, they gan to flie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both armed Knights and eke unarmed rout;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet Talus after them apace did plie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where ever in the darke he could them spie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That here and there like scattred sheepe they lay:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then, backe returning where his Dame did lie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He to her told the story of that fray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all that treason there intended did bewray.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Wherewith though wondrous wroth, and inly burning</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be avenged for so fowle a deede,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet being forst to abide the daies returning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She there remain’d; but with right wary heede,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Least any more such practise should proceede.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now mote ye know (that which to Britomart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unknowen was) whence all this did proceede;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And for what cause so great mischievous smart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was meant to her that never evill ment in hart.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The goodman of this house was Dolon hight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A man of subtill wit and wicked minde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That whilome in his youth had bene a Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And armes had borne, but little good could finde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And much lesse honour by that warlike kinde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of life: for he was nothing valorous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But with slie shiftes and wiles did underminde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All noble Knights, which were adventurous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And many brought to shame by treason treacherous.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He had three sonnes, all three like fathers sonnes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like treacherous, like full of fraud and guile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all that on this earthly compasse wonnes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The eldest of the which was slaine erewhile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By Artegall, through his owne guilty wile:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His name was Guizor; whose untimely fate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For to avenge, full many treasons vile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His father Dolon had deviz’d of late</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With these his wicked sons, and shewd his cankred hate.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For sure he weend that this his present guest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was Artegall, by many tokens plaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But chiefly by that yron page he ghest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which still was wont with Artegall remaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And therefore ment him surely to have slaine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But by Gods grace, and her good heedinesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She was preserved from their traytrous traine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus she all night wore out in watchfulnesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne suffred slothfull sleepe her eyelids to oppresse.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The morrow next, so soone as dawning houre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Discovered had the light to living eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She forth yssew’d out of her loathed bowre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With full intent t’avenge that villany</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On that vilde man and all his family;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, comming down to seeke them where they wond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor sire, nor sonnes, not any could she spie:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Each rowme she sought, but them all empty fond.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They all were fled for feare; but whether, nether kond.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She saw it vaine to make there lenger stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But tooke her steede; and thereon mounting light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gan her addresse unto her former way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She had not rid the mountenance of a flight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that she saw there present in her sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those two false brethren on that perillous Bridge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On which Pollente with Artegall did fight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Streight was the passage, like a ploughed ridge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, if two met, the one mote needes fall over the lidge.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There they did thinke them selves on her to wreake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who as she nigh unto them drew, the one</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These vile reproches gan unto her speake:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Thou recreant false traytor, that with lone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of armes hast knighthood stolne, yet Knight art none,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No more shall now the darkenesse of the night</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Defend thee from the vengeance of thy fone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But with thy bloud thou shalt appease the spright</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Guizor by thee slaine, and murdred by thy slight.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Strange were the words in Britomartis eare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet stayd she not for them, but forward fared,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till to the perillous Bridge she came; and there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Talus desir’d that he might have prepared</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The way to her, and those two losels scared;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But she thereat was wroth, that for despight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The glauncing sparkles through her bever glared,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from her eies did flash out fiery light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like coles that through a silver Censer sparkle bright.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She stayd not to advise which way to take,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But putting spurres unto her fiery beast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thorough the midst of them she way did make.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The one of them, which most her wrath increast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uppon her speare she bore before her breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till to the Bridges further end she past;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where falling downe his challenge he releast:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The other over side the Bridge she cast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the river, where he drunke his deadly last.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As when the flashing Levin haps to light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uppon two stubborne oakes, which stand so neare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That way betwixt them none appeares in sight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Engin, fiercely flying forth, doth teare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Th’one from the earth, and through the aire doth beare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The other it with force doth overthrow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uppon one side, and from his rootes doth reare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So did the Championesse those two there strow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to their sire their carcasses left to bestow.</span>

						<span>Britomart comes to Isis Church,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Where shee strange visions sees:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She fights with Radigund, her slaies,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And Artegall thence frees.</span>
					</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					<span>Nought is on earth more sacred or divine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Gods and men doe equally adore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then this same vertue that doth right define:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For th’hevens themselves, whence mortal men implore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Right in their wrongs, are rul’d by righteous lore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of highest Jove, who doth true justice deale</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To his inferiour Gods, and evermore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therewith containes his heavenly Common-weale:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The skill whereof to Princes hearts he doth reveale.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Well therefore did the antique world invent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Justice was a God of soveraine grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And altars unto him and temples lent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And heavenly honours in the highest place;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Calling him great Osyris, of the race</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of th’old Egyptian Kings that whylome were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With fayned colours shading a true case;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For that Osyris, whilest he lived here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The justest man alive and truest did appeare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His wife was Isis; whom they likewise made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A Goddesse of great powre and soverainty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in her person cunningly did shade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That part of Justice which is Equity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereof I have to treat here presently:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto whose temple when as Britomart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Arrived, shee with great humility</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did enter in, ne would that night depart;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Talus mote not be admitted to her part.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There she received was in goodly wize</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of many Priests, which duely did attend</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uppon the rites and daily sacrifize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All clad in linnen robes with silver hemd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on their heads, with long locks comely kemd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They wore rich Mitres shaped like the Moone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To shew that Isis doth the Moone portend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like as Osyris signifies the Sunne:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that they both like race in equall justice runne.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Championesse them greeting, as she could,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was thence by them into the Temple led;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose goodly building when she did behould,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Borne uppon stately pillours, all dispred</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With shining gold, and arched over hed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She wondred at the workemans passing skill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose like before she never saw nor red;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thereuppon long while stood gazing still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But thought that she thereon could never gaze her fill.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thence forth unto the Idoll they her brought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which was framed all of silver fine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So well as could with cunning hand be wrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And clothed all in garments made of line,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hemd all about with fringe of silver twine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uppon her head she wore a Crowne of gold;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To shew that she had powre in things divine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And at her feete a Crocodile was rold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That with her wreathed taile her middle did enfold.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One foote was set uppon the Crocodile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on the ground the other fast did stand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So meaning to suppresse both forged guile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And open force: and in her other hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She stretched forth a long white sclender wand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such was the Goddesse; whom when Britomart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had long beheld, her selfe uppon the land</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She did prostrate, and with right humble hart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto her selfe her silent prayers did impart.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To which the Idoll, as it were inclining,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her wand did move with amiable looke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By outward shew her inward sence desining:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who well perceiving how her wand she shooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It as a token of good fortune tooke.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By this the day with dampe was overcast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And joyous light the house of Jove forsooke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which when she saw her helmet she unlaste,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by the altars side her selfe to slumber plaste.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For other beds the Priests there used none,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But on their mother Earths deare lap did lie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And bake their sides uppon the cold hard stone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">T’enure them selves to sufferaunce thereby,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And proud rebellious flesh to mortify:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For by the vow of their religion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They tied were to stedfast chastity</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And continence of life, that, all forgon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They mote the better tend to their devotion.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Therefore they mote not taste of fleshly food,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne feed on ought the which doth bloud containe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne drinke of wine; for wine, they say, is blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even the bloud of Gyants, which were slaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By thundring Jove in the Phlegrean plaine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For which the earth (as they the story tell)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wroth with the Gods, which to perpetuall paine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had damn’d her sonnes which gainst them did rebell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With inward griefe and malice did against them swell:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And of their vitall bloud, the which was shed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into her pregnant bosome, forth she brought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The fruitfull vine; whose liquor blouddy red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Having the mindes of men with fury fraught,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mote in them stirre up old rebellious thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To make new warre against the Gods againe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such is the powre of that same fruit, that nought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The fell contagion may thereof restraine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne within reasons rule her madding mood containe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There did the warlike Maide her selfe repose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under the wings of Isis all that night;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with sweete rest her heavy eyes did close,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After that long daies toile and weary plight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where whilest her earthly parts with soft delight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of sencelesse sleepe did deeply drowned lie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There did appeare unto her heavenly spright</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A wondrous vision, which did close implie</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The course of all her fortune and posteritie.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Her seem’d, as she was doing sacrifize</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To Isis, deckt with Mitre on her hed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And linnen stole after those Priestes guize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All sodainely she saw transfigured</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her linnen stole to robe of scarlet red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Moone-like Mitre to a Crowne of gold;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That even she her selfe much wondered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At such a chaunge, and joyed to behold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her selfe adorn’d with gems and jewels manifold.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And, in the midst of her felicity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An hideous tempest seemed from below</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To rise through all the Temple sodainely,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That from the Altar all about did blow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The holy fire, and all the embers strow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uppon the ground; which, kindled privily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into outragious flames unwares did grow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all the Temple put in jeopardy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of flaming, and her selfe in great perplexity.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that the Crocodile, which sleeping lay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under the Idols feete in fearelesse bowre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seem’d to awake in horrible dismay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As being troubled with that stormy stowre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gaping greedy wide did streight devoure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both flames and tempest: with which growen great,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And swolne with pride of his owne peerelesse powre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He gan to threaten her likewise to eat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that the Goddesse with her rod him backe did beat.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tho turning all his pride to humblesse meeke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him selfe before her feete he lowly threw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gan for grace and love of her to seeke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which she accepting, he so neare her drew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That of his game she soone enwombed grew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And forth did bring a Lion of great might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That shortly did all other beasts subdew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With that she waked full of fearefull fright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And doubtfully dismayd through that so uncouth sight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So thereuppon long while she musing lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With thousand thoughts feeding her fantasie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Untill she spide the lampe of lightsome day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up-lifted in the porch of heaven hie:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then up she rose fraught with melancholy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And forth into the lower parts did pas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereas the Priestes she found full busily</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">About their holy things for morrow Mas;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whom she saluting faire, faire resaluted was:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But by the change of her unchearefull looke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They might perceive she was not well in plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or that some pensivenesse to heart she tooke:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore thus one of them, who seem’d in sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be the greatest and the gravest wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To her bespake: “Sir Knight, it seemes to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, thorough evill rest of this last night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or ill apayd or much dismayd ye be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That by your change of cheare is easie for to see.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Certes,” (sayd she) “sith ye so well have spide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The troublous passion of my pensive mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I will not seeke the same from you to hide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But will my cares unfolde, in hope to find</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Your aide to guide me out of errour blind.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Say on” (quoth he) “the secret of your hart;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For, by the holy vow which me doth bind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I am adjur’d best counsell to impart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To all that shall require my comfort in their smart.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then gan she to declare the whole discourse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all that vision which to her jippeard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As well as to her minde it had recourse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All which when he unto the end had heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like to a weake faint-hearted man he fared</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through great astonishment of that strange sight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, with long locks up-standing, stifly stared</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like one adawed with some dreadfull spright:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So, fild with heavenly fury, thus he her benight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Magnificke Virgin, that in queint disguise</span>

					<span>So blesse thee God, and give theejoyance of thy dreame!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All which when she unto the end had heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She much was eased in her troublous thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on those Priests bestowed rich reward;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And royall gifts of gold and silver wrought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She for a present to their Goddesse brought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then taking leave of them, she forward went</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To seeke her love, where he was to be sought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne rested till she came without relent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the land of Amazons, as she was bent.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whereof when newes to Radigund was brought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not with amaze, as women wonted bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She was confused in her troublous thought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But fild with courage and with joyous glee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As glad to heare of armes, the which now she</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had long surceast, she bad to open bold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That she the face of her new foe might see:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when they of that yron man had told,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which late her folke had slaine, she bad them forth to hold.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So there without the gate, (as seemed best)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She caused her Pavilion be pight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which stout Britomart her selfe did rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whiles Talus watched at the dore all night.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All night likewise they of the towne in fright</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uppon their wall good watch and ward did keepe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The morrow next, so soone as dawning light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bad doe away the dampe of drouzie sleepe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The warlike Amazon out of her bowre did peepe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And caused streight a Trumpet loud to shrill</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To warne her foe to battell soone be prest:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, long before awoke, (for she ful ill</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could sleepe all night, that in unquiet brest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did closely harbour such a jealous guest)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was to the battell whilome ready (light.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eftsoones that warriouresse with haughty crest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did forth issue all ready for the fight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On th’other side her foe appeared soone in sight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But ere they reared hand the Amazone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began the streight conditions to propound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which she used still to tye her fone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To serve her so as she the rest had bound:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which when the other heard, she sternly frownd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For high disdaine of such indignity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And would no lenger treat, but bad them sound;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For her no other termes should ever tie</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then what prescribed were by lawes of chevalrie.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Trumpets sound, and they together run</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With greedy rage, and with their faulchins smot;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne either sought the others strokes to shun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But through great fury both their skill forgot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And practicke use in armes; ne spared not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their dainty parts, which nature had created</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So faire and tender without staine or spot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For other uses then they them translated;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which they now hackt and hewd as if such use they hated.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As when a Tygre and a Lionesse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are met at spoyling of some hungry pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both challenge it with equall greedinesse:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But first the Tygre clawes thereon did lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And therefore, loth to loose her right away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth in defence thereof full stoutly stond:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which the Lion strongly doth gainesay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That she to hunt the beast first tooke in hond;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore ought it have where ever she it fond.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Full fiercely layde the Amazon about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And dealt her blowes unmercifully sore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which Britomart withstood with courage stout,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And them repaide againe with double more.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So long they fought, that all the grassie flore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was fild with bloud which from their sides did flow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gushed through their armes, that all in gore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They trode, and on the ground their lives did strow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like fruitles seede, of which untimely death should grow.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At last proud Radigund, with fell despight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Having by chaunce espide advantage neare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let drive at her with all her dreadfull might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thus upbrayding said: “This token beare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the man whom thou doest love so deare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And tell him for his sake thy life thou gavest.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which spitefull words she, sore engriev’d to heare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus answer’d: “Lewdly thou my love depravest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who shortly must repent that now so vainely bravest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nath’lesse that stroke so cruell passage found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That glauncing on her shoulder-plate it bit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the bone, and made a griesly wound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That she her shield, through raging smart of it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could scarse uphold: yet soone she it requit;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For, having force increast through furious paine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She her so rudely on the helmet smit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it empierced to the very braine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And her proud person low prostrated on the plaine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Where being layd, the wrothfull Britonesse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stayd not till she came to her selfe againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But in revenge both of her loves distresse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And her late vile reproch though vaunted vaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And also of her wound which sore did paine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She with one stroke both head and helmet cleft.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which dreadfull sight when all her warlike traine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There present saw, each one of sence bereft</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fled fast into the towne, and her sole victor left.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But yet so fast they could not home retrate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that swift Talus did the formost win;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, pressing through the preace unto the gate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pelmell with them attonce did enter in.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There then a piteous slaughter did begin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For all that ever came within his reach</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He with his yron flale did thresh so thin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he no worke at all left for the leach:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like to an hideous storme, which nothing may empeach.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And now by this the noble Conqueresse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her selfe came in, her glory to partake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where, though revengefull vow she did professe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet when she saw the heapes which he did make</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of slaughtred carkasses, her heart did quake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For very ruth, which did it almost rive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That she his fury willed him to slake:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For else he sure had left not one alive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But all, in his revenge, of spirite would deprive.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tho, when she had his execution stayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She for that yron prison did enquire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which her wretched love was captive layd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which breaking open with indignant ire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She entred into all the partes entire:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where when she saw that lothly uncouth sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of men disguiz’d in womanishe attire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her heart gan grudge for very deepe despight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of so unmanly maske in misery misdight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At last when as to her owne Love she came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom like disguize no lesse deformed had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At sight thereof abasht with secrete shame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She turnd her head aside, as nothing glad</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To have beheld a spectacle so bad;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then too well believ’d that which tofore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Jealous suspect as true untruely drad:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which vaine conceipt now nourishing no more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She sought with ruth to salve his sad misfortunes sore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Not so great wonder and astonishment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did the most chast Penelope possesse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see her Lord, that was reported drent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And dead long since in dolorous distresse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Come home to her in piteous wretchednesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After long travell of full twenty yeares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That she knew not his favours likelynesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For many scarres and many hoary heares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But stood long staring on him mongst uncertaine feares.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Ah, my deare Lord! what sight is this?” quoth she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“What May-game hath misfortune made of you?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where is that dreadfull manly looke? where be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those mighty palmes, the which ye wont t’embrew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In bloud of Kings, and great hoastes to subdew?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could ought on earth so wondrous change have wrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As to have robde you of that manly hew?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could so great courage stouped have to ought?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, farewell fleshly force! I see thy pride is nought.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thenceforth she streight into a bowre him brought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And causd him those uncomely weedes undight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in their steede for other rayment sought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereof there was great store, and armors bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which had bene reft from many a noble Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom that proud Amazon subdewed had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whilest Fortune favourd her successe in fight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which when as she him anew had clad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She was reviv’d, and joyd much in his semblance glad.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So there a while they afterwards remained.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him to refresh, and her late wounds to heale:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">During which space she there as Princess rained,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And changing all that forme of common-weale</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The liberty of women did repeale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which they had long usurpt; and, them restoring</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To mens subjection, did true Justice deale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all they, as a Goddesse her adoring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her wisedome did admire, and hearkned to her loring.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For all those Knights, which long in captive shade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had shrowded bene, she did from thraldome free,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And magistrates of all that city made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gave to them great living and large fee:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that they should for ever faithfull bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made them sweare fealty to Artegall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who when him selfe now well recur’d did see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He purposd to proceed, what so befall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Uppon his first adventure which him forth did call.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Full sad and sorrowfull was Britomart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For his departure, her new cause of griefe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet wisely moderated her owne smart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeing his honor, which she tehdred chiefe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Consisted much in that adventures priefe:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The care whereof, and hope of his successe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gave unto her great comfort and reliefe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That womanish complaints she did represse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And tempred for the time her present heavinesse.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There she continu’d for a certaine space,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till through his want her woe did more increase:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then hoping that the change of aire and place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would change her paine, and sorrow somewhat ease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She parted thence her anguish to appease.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Meane-while her noble Lord, sir Artegall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Went on his way; ne ever howre did cease</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till he redeemed had that Lady thrall:</span>

					<br/>
					<span>The true guide of his way and vertuous government.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So travelling, he chaunst far off to heed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A Damzell, flying on a palfrey fast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before two Knights that after her did speed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With all their powre, and her full fiercely chast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In hope to have her overhent at last:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet fled she fast, and both them farre outwent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Carried with wings of feare, like fowle aghast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With locks all loose, and rayment all to-rent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ever as she rode her eye was backeward bent.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Soone after these he saw another Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That after those two former rode apace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With speare in rest, and prickt with all his might</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So ran they all, as they had bene at bace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They being chased that did others chase.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At length he saw the hindmost overtake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One of those two, and force him turne his face;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">However loth he were his way to slake,</span>

					<span class="i1">Till that at length she did before her spie</span>

					<span class="i1">Succour against her greedy enimy:</span>
					<br/>

					<span>To save her from her feare, and him from force to let.</span>
				</p>

					<span>But he, like hound full greedy of his pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Being impatient of impediment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Continu’d still his course, and by the way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thought with his speare him quight have overwent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So both together, ylike felly bent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like fiercely met. But Artegall was stronger,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And better skild in Tilt and Turnament,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And bore him quite out of his saddle, longer</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then two speares length: So mischiefe overmatcht the wronger.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And in his fall misfortune him mistooke;</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all his bowels in his body brast:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom leaving there in that dispiteous plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He ran still on, thinking to follow fast</span>
					<br/>

					<span>Instead of whom finding there ready prest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sir Artegall, without discretion</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, seeing him come still so fiercely on,</span>
					<br/>

					<span class="i1">And broke their speares; yet neither has forgon</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His horses backe, yet to and fro long shooke</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And tottred, like two towres which through a tempest quooke.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, when againe they had recovered sence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They drew their swords, in mind to make amends</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For what their speares had fayld of their pretence:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which when the Damzell, who those deadly ends</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of both her foes had scene, and now her frends</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For her beginning a more fearefull fray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She to them runnes in hast, and her haire rends,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Crying to them their cruell hands to stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Untill they both doe heare what she to them will say.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They stayd their hands, when she thus gan to speake:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Ah gentle Knights! what meane ye thus unwise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon your selves anothers wrong to wreake?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I am the wrong’d, whom ye did enterprise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both to redresse, and both redrest likewise:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Witnesse the Paynims both, whom ye may see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There dead on ground. What doe ye then devise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of more revenge? if more, then I am shee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which was the roote of all: end your revenge on mee.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whom when they heard so say, they lookt about</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To weete if it were true as she had told;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where when they saw their foes dead out of doubt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eftsoones they gan their wrothfull hands to hold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Ventailes reare each other to behold.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tho when as Artegall did Arthure vew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So faire a creature and so wondrous bold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He much admired both his heart and hew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And touched with intire affection nigh him drew;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Saying, “Sir Knight, of pardon I you pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all unweeting have you wrong’d thus sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Suffring my hand against my heart to stray;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which if ye please forgive, I will therefore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yeeld for amends my selfe yours evermore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or what so penaunce shall by you be red.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom the Prince: “Certes me needeth more</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To crave the same; whom errour so misled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As that I did mistake the living for the ded.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But, sith ye please that both our blames shall die,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Amends may for the trespasse soone be made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since neither is endamadg’d much thereby.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So can they both them selves full eath perswade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To faire accordaunce, and both faults to shade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Either embracing other lovingly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And swearing faith to either on his blade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Never thenceforth to nourish enmity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But either others cause to maintaine mutually.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then Artegall gan of the Prince enquire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What were those knights which there on ground were layd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And had receiv’d their follies worthy hire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And for what cause they chased so that Mayd?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Certes I wote not well,” (the Prince then sayd)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“But by adventure found them faring so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As by the way unweetingly I strayd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And lo! the Damzell selfe, whence all did grow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of whom we may at will the whole occasion know.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then they that Damzell called to them nie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And asked her what were those two her fone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From whom she earst so fast away did flie:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And what was she her selfe so woe-begone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And for what cause pursu’d of them attone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom she thus: “Then wote ye well, that I</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doe serve a Queene that not far hence doth wone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A Princesse of great powre and majestic,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Famous through all the world, and honor’d far and nie.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Her name Mercilla most men use to call;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That is a mayden Queene of high renowne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For her great bounty knowen over all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And soveraine grace, with which her royall crowne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She doth support, and strongly beateth downe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The malice of her foes, which her envy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And at her happinesse do fret and frowne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet she her selfe the more doth magnify,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even to her foes her mercies multiply.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Mongst many which maligne her happy state,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There is a mighty man, which wonnes hereby,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with most fell despight and deadly hate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seekes to subvert her Crowne and dignity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all his powre doth thereunto apply:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And her good Knights, of which so brave a band</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Serves her as any Princesse under sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He either spoiles, if they against him stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or to his part allures, and bribeth under hand.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Ne him sufficeth all the wrong and ill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which he unto her people does each day;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that he seekes by traytrous traines to spill</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her person, and her sacred selfe to slay:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, O ye Heavens, defend! and turne away</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From her unto the miscreant him selfe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That neither hath religion nor fay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But makes his God of his ungodly pelfe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Idols serves: so let his Idols serve the Elfe!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“To all which cruell tyranny, they say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He is provokt, and stird up day and night</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By his bad wife that hight Adicia;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who counsels him, through confidence of might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To breake all bonds of law and rules of right:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For she her selfe professeth mortall foe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To Justice, and against her still doth fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Working to all that love her deadly woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And making all her Knights and people to doe so.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Which my liege Lady seeing, thought it best</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With that his wife in friendly wise to deale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For stint of strife and stablishment of rest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both to her selfe and to her common-weale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all forepast displeasures to repeale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So me in message unto her she sent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To treat with her, by way of enterdeale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of finall peace and faire attonement</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which might concluded be by mutuall consent.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“All times have wont safe passage to afford</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To messengers that come for causes just:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But this proude Dame, disdayning all accord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not onely into bitter termes forth brust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Reviling me and rayling as she lust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But lastly, to make proofe of utmost shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Me like a dog she out of dores did thrust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Miscalling me by many a bitter name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That never did her ill, ne once deserved blame.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“And lastly, that no shame might wanting be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I was gone, soone after me she sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These two false Knights, whom there ye lying see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be by them dishonoured and shent:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, thankt be God, and your good hardiment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They have the price of their pwne folly payd.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So said this Damzell, that hight Samient;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to those knights for their so noble ayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her selfe most gratefull shew’d, and heaped thanks repayd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But they now having throughly heard and scene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Al those great wrongs, the which that mayd complained</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To have bene done against her Lady Queene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By that proud dame which her so much disdained,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were moved much thereat; and twixt them fained</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With all their force to worke avengement strong</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uppon the Souldan selfe, which it mayntained,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on his Lady, th’author of that wrong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And uppon all those Knights that did to her belong.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, thinking best by counterfet disguise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To their deseigne to make the easier way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They did this complot twixt them selves devise:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">First, that Sir Artegall should him array</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like one of those two Knights which dead there lay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then that Damzell, the sad Samient,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should as his purchast prize with him convay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the Souldans court, her to present</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto his scornefull Lady that for her had sent.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So as they had deviz’d, Sir Artegall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him clad in th’armour of a Pagan knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And taking with him, as his vanquisht thrall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Damzell, led her to the Souldans right:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where soone as his proud wife of her had sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forth of her window as she looking lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She weened streight it was her Paynim Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which brought that Damzell as his purchast pray;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sent to him a Page that mote direcl: his way.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who bringing them to their appointed place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Offred his service to disarme the Knight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he refusing him to let unlace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For doubt to be discovered by his sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Kept himselfe still in his straunge armour dight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Soone after whom the Prince arrived there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sending to the Souldan in despight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A bold defyance, did of him requere</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Damsell whom he held as wrongfull prisonere.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Wherewith the Souldan all with furie fraught,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Swearing and banning most blasphemously,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Commaunded straight his armour to be brought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, mounting straight upon a charret hye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(With yron wheeles and hookes arm’d dreadfully,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And drawne of cruell steedes which he had fed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With flesh of men, whom through fell tyranny</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He slaughtred had, and ere they were halfe ded</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their bodies to his beastes for provender did spred,)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So forth he came, all in a cote of plate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Burnisht with bloudie rust; whiles on the greene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Briton Prince him readie did awayte,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In glistering armes right goodly well-beseene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That shone as bright as doth the heaven sheene:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by his stirrup Talus did attend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Playing his pages part, as he had beene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before directed by his Lord; to th’end</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He should his flale to final execution bend.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus goe they both together to their geare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With like fierce minds, but meanings different;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the proud Souldan, with presumpteous cheare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And countenance sublime and insolent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sought onely slaughter and avengement;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But the brave Prince for honour and for right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gainst tortious powre and lawlesse regiment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the behalfe of wronged weake did fight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More in his causes truth he trusted then in might.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like to the Thracian Tyrant, who they say</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto his horses gave his guests for meat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till he himselfe was made their greedie pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And torne in pieces by Alcides great;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So thought the Souldan, in his follies threat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Either the Prince in peeces to have torne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With his sharp wheeles, in his first rages heat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or under his fierce horses feet have borne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And trampled downe in dust his thoughts disdained scorne.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But the bold child that perill well espying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If he too rashly to his charet drew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gave way unto his horses speedie flying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And their resistlesse rigour did eschew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet, as he passed by, the Pagan threw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A shivering dart with so impetuous force,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That had he not it shun’d with heedfull vew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It had himselfe transfixed or his horse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or made them both one masse withouten more remorse.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Oft drew the Prince unto his charret nigh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In hope some stroke to fasten on him neare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he was mounted in his seat so high,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And his wingfooted coursers him did beare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So fast away that, ere his readie speare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He could advance, he farre was gone and past:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet still he him did follow every where,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And followed was of him likewise full fast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So long as in his steedes the flaming breath did last.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Againe the Pagan threw another dart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which he had with him abundant store</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On every side of his embatteld cart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of all other weapons lesse or more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which warlike uses had deviz’d of yore:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The wicked shaft, guyded through th’ayrie wyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By some bad spirit that it to mischiefe bore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stayd not, till through his curat it did glyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And made a griesly wound in his enriven side.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Much was he grieved with that haplesse throe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That opened had the welspring of his blood;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But much the more, that to his hatefull foe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He mote not come to wreake his wrathfull mood:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That made him rave, like to a Lyon wood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which being wounded of the huntsmans hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cannot come neare him in the covert wood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where he with boughes hath built his shady stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fenst himselfe about with many a flaming brand.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Still when he sought t’approch unto him ny</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His charret wheeles about him whirled round,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And made him backe againe as fast to fly;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke his steedes, like to an hungry hound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That hunting after game hath carrion found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So cruelly did him pursew and chace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That his good steed, all were he much renound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For noble courage and for hardie race,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Durst not endure their sight, but fled from place to place.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus long they trast and traverst to and fro,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeking by every way to make some breach;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet could the Prince not nigh unto him goe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That one sure stroke he might unto him reach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereby his strengthes assay he might him teach.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At last from his victorious shield he drew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The vaile, which did his powrefull light empeach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And comming full before his horses vew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As they upon him prest, it plaine to them did shew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like lightening flash that hath the gazer burned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So did the sight thereof their sense dismay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That backe againe upon themselves they turned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with their ryder ranne perforce away:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne could the Souldan them from flying stay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With raynes or wonted rule, as well he knew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nought feared they what he could do or say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But th’onely feare that was before their vew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From which like mazed deare dismayfully they flew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Fast did they fly as them their feete could beare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">High over hilles, and lowly over dales,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As they were follow’d of their former feare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In vaine the Pagan bannes, and sweares, and rayles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And backe with both his hands unto him hayles</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The resty raynes, regarded now no more:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He to them calles and speakes, yet nought avayles;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They heare him not, they have forgot his lore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But go which way they list, their guide they have forlore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As when the fine-mouthed steedes, which drew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Sunnes bright wayne to Phaetons decay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Soone as they did the monstrous Scorpion vew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With ugly craples crawling in their way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The dreadfull sight did them so sore affray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That their well-knowen courses they forwent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, leading th’ever-burning lampe astray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This lower world nigh all to ashes brent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And left their scorched path yet in the firmament.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Such was the furie of these head-strong steeds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Soone as the infants sunlike shield they saw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all obedience both to words and deeds</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They quite forgot, and scornd all former law:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through woods, and rocks, and mountaines they did draw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The yron charet, and the wheeles did teare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And tost the Paynim without feare or awe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From side to side they tost him here and there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Crying to them in vaine that nould his crying heare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet still the Prince pursew’d him close behind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Oft making offer him to smite, but found</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No easie meanes according to his mind:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At last they have all overthrowne to ground</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Quite topside turvey, and the Pagan hound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Amongst the yron hookes and graples keene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Torne all to rags, and rent with many a wound;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That no whole peece of him was to be scene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But scattred all about, and strow’d upon the greene.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like as the cursed son of Theseus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That following his chace in dewy morne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To fly his stepdames loves outrageous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his owne steedes was all to peeces torne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And his faire limbs left in the woods forlorne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That for his sake Diana did lament,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the wooddy Nymphes did wayle and mourne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So was this Souldan rapt and all to-rent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of his shape appear’d no litle moniment.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Onely his shield and armour, which there lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Though nothing whole, but all to-brusd and broken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He up did take, and with him brought away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That mote remaine for an eternall token</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To all mongst whom this storie should be spoken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How worthily, by heavens high decree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Justice that day of wrong her selfe had wroken;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all men, which that spectacle did see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By like ensample mote for ever warned bee.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So on a tree before the Tyrants dore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He caused them be hung in all mens sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be a moniment for evermore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which when his Ladie from the castles hight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beheld, it much appald her troubled spright:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet not, as women wont, in dolefull fit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She was dismayd, or faynted through affright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But gathered unto her her troubled wit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gan eftsoones devize to be aveng’d for it.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Streight downe she ranne, like an enraged cow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That is berobbed of her youngling dere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With knife in hand, and fatally did vow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To wreake her on that mayden messengere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom she had causd be kept as prisonere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By Artegall, misween’d for her owne Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That brought her backe: And, comming present there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She at her ran with all her force and might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All flaming with revenge and furious despight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like raging Ino, when with knife in hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She threw her husbands murdred infant out;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or fell Medea, when on Colchicke strand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her brothers bones she scattered all about;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or as that madding mother, mongst the rout</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Bacchus Priests, her owne deare flesh did teare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet neither Ino, nor Medea stout,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor all the Mcenades so furious were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As this bold woman when she saw that Damzell there.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Artegall, being thereof aware,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did stay her cruell hand ere she her raught;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, as she did her selfe to strike prepare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of her fist the wicked weapon caught:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With that, like one enfelon’d or distraught,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She forth did rome whether her rage her bore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With franticke passion and with furie fraught;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, breaking forth out at a posterne dore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the wyld wood ranne, her dolours to deplore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As a mad bytch, when as the franticke fit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her burning tongue with rage inflamed hath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth runne at randon, and with furious bit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Snatching at every thing doth wreake her wrath</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On man and beast that commeth in her path.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There they doe say that she transformed was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into a Tygre, and that Tygres scath</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In crueltie and outrage she did pas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To prove her surname true, that she imposed has.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then Artegall, himselfe discovering plaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did issue forth gainst all that warlike rout</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of knights and armed men, which did maintaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Ladies part, and to the Souldan lout:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All which he did assault with courage stout,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All were they nigh an hundred knights of name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And like wyld Goates them chaced all about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Flying from place to place with cowheard shame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that with finall force them all he overcame.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then caused he the gates be opened wyde;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And there the Prince, as victour of that day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With tryumph entertayn’d and glorifyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Presenting him with all the rich array</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And roiall pompe, which there long hidden lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Purchast through lawlesse powre and tortious wrong</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that proud Souldan whom he earst did slay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So both, for rest, there having stayd not long,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Marcht with that mayd; fit matter for another song.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto that Damzell in her Ladies right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And so would have departed on their way;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But she them woo’d, by all the meanes she might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And earnestly besought to wend that day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With her, to see her Ladie thence not farre away.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>By whose entreatie both they overcommen</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Agree to goe with her; and by the way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(As often falles) of sundry things did commen:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mongst which that Damzell did to them bewray</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A straunge adventure, which not farre thence lay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To weet, a wicked villaine, bold and stout,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which wonned in a rocke not farre away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That robbed all the countrie there about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And brought the pillage home, whence none could get it out.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thereto both his owne wylie wit, (she sayd)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke the fastnesse of his dwelling place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both unassaylable, gave him great ayde:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For he so crafty was to forge and face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So light of hand, and nymble of his pace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So smooth of tongue, and subtile in his tale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That could deceive one looking in his face:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore by name Malengin they him call,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well knowen by his feates, and famous over all.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Through these his slights he many doth confound:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke the rocke, in which he wonts to dwell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is wondrous strong and hewen farre under ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A dreadfull depth; how deepe no man can tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But some doe say it goeth downe to hell:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all within it full of wyndings is</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hidden wayes, that scarse an hound by smell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Can follow out those false footsteps of his,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne none can backe returne that once are gone amis.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when those knights had heard, their harts gan earne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To understand that villeins dwelling place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And greatly it desir’d of her to learne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by which way they towards it should trace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Were not” (sayd she) “that it should let your pace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Towards my Ladies presence, by you ment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I would you guyde directly to the place.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Then let not that” (said they) “stay your intent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For neither will one foot, till we that carle have hent.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So forth they past, till they approched ny</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the rocke where was the villains won:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which when the Damzell neare at hand did spy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She warn’d the knights thereof; who thereupon</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gan to advize what best were to be done.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So both agreed to send that mayd afore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where she might sit nigh to the den alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wayling, and raysing pittifull uprore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if she did some great calamitie deplore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With noyse whereof when as the caytive carle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should issue forth, in hope to find some spoyle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They in awayt would closely him ensnarle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere to his den he backward could recoyle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And so would hope him easily to foyle.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Damzell straight went, as she was directed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the rocke; and there, upon the soyle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Having her selfe in wretched wize abjecled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gan weepe and wayle, as if great griefe had her affected.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The cry whereof entring the hollow cave</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eftsoones brought forth the villaine, as they ment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With hope of her some wishfull boot to have.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full dreadfull wight he was as ever went</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the earth, with hollow eyes deepe pent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And long curld locks that downe his shoulders shagged;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on his backe an uncouth vestiment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made of straunge stuffe, but all to-worne and ragged,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And underneath, his breech was all to-torne and jagged.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And in his hand an huge long staffe he held,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose top was arm’d with many an yron hboke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fit to catch hold of all that he could weld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or in the compasse of his douches tooke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ever round about he cast his looke:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Als at his backe a great wyde net he bore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which he seldome fished at the brooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But usd to fish for fooles on the dry shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of which he in faire weather wont to take great store.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Him when the damzell saw fast by her side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So ugly creature, she was nigh dismayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now for helpe aloud in earnest cride:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when the villame saw her so affrayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He gan with guilefull words her to perswade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To banish feare; and, with Sardonian smyle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Laughing on her, his false intent to shade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gan forth to lay his bayte her to beguyle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That from her self unwares he might her steale the whyle.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like as the fouler on his guilefull pype</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Charmes to the birds full many a pleasant lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That they the whiles may take lesse heedie keepe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How he his nets doth for their ruine lay:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So did the villaine to her prate and play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And many pleasant trickes before her show,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To turne her eyes from his intent away;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For he in slights and jugling feates did flow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of legierdemayne the mysteries did know.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To which whilest she lent her intentive mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He suddenly his net upon her threw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That oversprad her like a puffe of wind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And snatching her soone up, ere well she knew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ran with her fast away unto his mew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Crying for helpe aloud: But when as ny</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He came unto his cave, and there did vew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The armed knights stopping his passage by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He threw his burden downe, and fast away did fly.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Artegall him after did pursew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whiles the Prince there kept the entrance still.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up to the rocke he ran, and thereon flew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like a wyld Gote, leaping from hill to hill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And dauncing on the craggy cliffes at will;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That deadly daunger seem’d in all mens sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To tempt such steps, where footing was so ill;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ought avayled for the armed knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To thinke to follow him that was so swift and light.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when he saw, his yron man he sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To follow him; for he was swift in chace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He him pursewd where ever that he went;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both over rockes, and hilles, and every place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where so he fled, he followd him apace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that he shortly forst him to forsake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The hight, and downe descend unto the base:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There he him courst a-fresh, and soone did make</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To leave his proper forme, and other shape to take.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Into a Foxe himselfe he first did tourne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he him hunted like a Foxe full fast:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then to a bush himselfe he did transforme;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he the bush did beat, till that at last</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into a bird it chaung’d, and from him past,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Flying from tree to tree, from wand to wand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he then stones at it so long did cast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That like a stone it fell upon the land;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he then tooke it up, and held fast in his hand.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So he it brought with him unto the knights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to his Lord Sir Artegall it lent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Warning him hold it fast for feare of slights:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who whilest in hand it gryping hard he hent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into a Hedgehogge all unwares it went,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And prickt him so that he away it threw:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then ganne it runne away incontinent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Being returned to his former hew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Talus soone him overtooke, and backward drew,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, when as he would to a snake againe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have turn’d himselfe, he with his yron flayle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gan drive at him with so huge might and maine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all his bones as small as sandy grayle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He broke, and did his bowels disentrayle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Crying in vaine for helpe, when helpe was past:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So did deceipt the selfe-deceiver fayle.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There they him left a carrion outcast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For beasts and foules to feede upon for their repast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thence forth they passed with that gentle Mayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see her Ladie, as they did agree;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which when she approched, thus she sayd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Loe! now, right noble knights, arriv’d ye bee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nigh to the place which ye desir’d to see:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There shall ye see my soverayne Lady Queene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Most sacred wight, most debonayre and free,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ever yet upon this earth was scene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or that with Diademe hath ever crowned beene.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The gentle knights rejoyced much to heare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The prayses of that Prince so manifold;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, passing litle further, commen were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where they a stately pallace did behold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of pompous show, much more then she had told;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With many towres, and tarras mounted hye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all their tops bright glistering with gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That seemed to outshine the dimmed skye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with their brightnesse daz’d the straunge beholders eye.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There they alighting by that Damzell were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Directed in, and shewed all the sight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose porch, that most magnificke did appeare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stood open wyde to all men day and night;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet warded well by one of mickle might</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That sate thereby, with gyantlike resemblance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To keepe out guyle, and malice, and despight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That under shew oftimes of fayned semblance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are wont in Princes courts to worke great scath and hindrance</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His name was Awe; by whom they passing in</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Went up the hall, that was a large wyde roome,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And full of people making troublous din</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wondrous noyse, as if that there were some</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which unto them was dealing righteous doome:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By whom they passing through the thickest preasse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The marshall of the hall to them did come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His name hight Order; who, commaunding peace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Them guyded through the throng, that did their clamors ceasse.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They ceast their clamors upon them to gaze;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom seeing all in armour bright as day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Straunge there to see, it did them much amaze,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with unwonted terror halfe affray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For never saw they there the like array;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ever was the name of warre there spoken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But joyous peace and quietnesse alway</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dealing just judgements, that mote not be broken</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For any brybes, or threates of any to be wroken.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There, as they entred at the Scriene, they saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some one whose tongue was for his trespasse vyle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nayld to a post, adjudged so by law;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For that therewith he falsely did revyle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And foule blaspheme that Queene for forged guyle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both with bold speaches which he blazed had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with lewd poems which he did compyle;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the bold title of a poet bad</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He on himselfe had ta’en, and rayling rymes had sprad.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus there he stood, whylest high over his head</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There written was the purport of his sin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In cyphers strange, that few could rightly read,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bon Font; but Bon, that once had written bin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was raced out, and Mai was now put in:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So now Malfont was plainely to be red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eyther for th’evill which he did therein,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or that he likened was to a welhed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of evill words, and wicked sclaunders by him shed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They, passing by, were guyded by degree</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the presence of that gratious Queene;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who sate on high, that she might all men see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And might of all men royally be scene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon a throne of gold full bright and sheene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Adorned all with gemmes of endlesse price,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As either might for wealth have gotten bene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or could be fram’d by workmans rare device;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all embost with Lyons and with Flour-delice.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All over her a cloth of state was spred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not of rich tissew, nor of cloth of gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor of ought else that may be richest red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But like a cloud, as likest may be told,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That her brode-spreading wings did wyde unfold;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose skirts were bordred with bright sunny beames,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Glistring like gold amongst the plights enrold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And here and there shooting forth silver streames,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mongst which crept litle Angels through the glittering gleames.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Seemed those litle Angels did uphold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The cloth of state, and on their purpled wings</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did beare the pendants through their nimblesse bold:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Besides, a thousand more of such as sings</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hymns to high God, and carols heavenly things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Encompassed the throne on which she sate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She, Angel-like, the heyre of ancient kings</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And mightie Conquerors, in royall state,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whylest kings and kesars at her feet did them prostrate.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus she did sit in soverayne Majestic,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Holding a Scepter in her royall hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sacred pledge of peace and clemencie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which high God had blest her happie land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Maugre so many foes which did withstand:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But at her feet her sword was likewise layde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose long rest rusted the bright steely brand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet when as foes enforst, or friends sought ayde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She could it sternely draw, that all the world dismayde.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And round about before her feet there sate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A bevie of faire Virgins clad in white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That goodly seem’d t’adorne her royall state;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All lovely daughters of high Jove, that hight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Litse, by him begot in loves delight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the righteous Themis; those, they say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon Joves judgement-seat wayt day and night;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, when in wrath he threats the worlds decay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They doe his anger calme, and cruell vengeance stay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They also doe, by his divine permission,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the thrones of mortall Princes tend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And often treat for pardon and remission</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To suppliants, through frayltie which offend:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those did upon Mercillaes throne attend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Just Dice, wise Eunomie, myld Eirene;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And them amongst, her glorie to commend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sate goodly Temperance in garments clene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sacred Reverence yborne of heavenly strene.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus did she sit in royall rich estate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Admyr’d of many, honoured of all;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whylest underneath her feete, there as she sate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An huge great Lyon lay, that mote appall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An hardie courage, like captived thrall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With a strong yron chaine and coller bound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That once he could not move, nor quich at all;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet did he murmure with rebellious sound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And softly royne, when salvage choler gan redound.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So sitting high in dreaded soverayntie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those two strange knights were to her presence brought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, bowing low before her Majestic,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did to her myld obeysance, as they ought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And meekest boone that they imagine mought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom she eke inclyning her withall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As a faire stoupe of her high soaring thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A chearefull countenance on them let fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet tempred with some majestic imperiall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As the bright sunne, what time his fierie teme</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Towards the westerne brim begins to draw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gins to abate the brightnesse of his beme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fervour of his flames somewhat adaw;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So did this mightie Ladie, when she saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those two strange knights such homage to her make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bate somewhat of that Majestic and awe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That whylome wont to doe so many quake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with more myld aspect those two to entertake.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now at that instant, as occasion fell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When these two stranger knights arriv’d in place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She was about affaires of common-wele,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dealing with Justice with indifferent grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hearing pleas of people meane and base:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mongst which, as then, there was for to be heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The tiyall of a great and weightie case,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which on both sides was then debating hard;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But at the sight of these those were awhile debard.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, after all her princely entertayne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To th’ hearing of that former cause in hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her selfe eftsoones she gan convert againe:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which that those knights likewise mote understand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And witnesse forth aright in forrain land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Taking them up unto her stately throne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where they mote heare the matter throughly scand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On either part, she placed th’one on th’one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other on the other side, and neare them none.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then was there brought, as prisoner to the barre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A Ladie of great countenance and place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that she it with foule abuse did marre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet did appeare rare beautie in her face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But blotted with condition vile and base,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all her other honour did obscure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And titles of nobilitie deface:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet in that wretched semblant she did sure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The peoples great compassion unto her allure.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then up arose a person of deepe reach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And rare in-sight hard matters to revele;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That well could charme his tongue, and time his speach</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To all assayes; his name was called Zele.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He gan that Ladie strongly to appele</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of many haynous crymes by her enured;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with sharp reasons rang her such a pele,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That those, whom she to pitie had allured,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He now t’abhorre and loath her person had procured.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>First gan he tell how this, that seem’d so faire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And royally arayd, Duessa hight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That false Duessa, which had wrought great care</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And mickle mischiefe unto many a knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By her beguyled and confounded quight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But not for those she now in question came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Though also those mote question’d be aright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But for vyld treasons and outrageous shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which she against the dred Mercilla oft did frame.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For she whylome (as ye mote yet right well</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Remember) had her counsels false conspyred</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With faithlesse Blandamour and Paridell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(Both two her paramours, both by her hyred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And both with hope of shadowes vaine inspyred)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with them pracliz’d, how for to depryve</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mercilla of her crowne, by her aspyred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That she might it unto her selfe deryve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And tryumph in their blood whom she to death did dryve.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But through high heavens grace, which favour not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The wicked driftes of trayterous desynes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gainst loiall Princes, all this cursed plot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere proofe it tooke, discovered was betymes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And th’aclours won the meede meet for their crymes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such be the meede of all that by such mene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the type of kingdomes title clymes!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But false Duessa, now untitled Queene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was brought to her sad doome, as here was to be scene.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Strongly did Zele her haynous fact enforce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And many other crimes of foule defame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against her brought, to banish all remorse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And aggravate the horror of her blame:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with him, to make part against her, came</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Many grave persons that against her pled.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">First was a sage old Syre, that had to name</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Kingdomes Care, with a white silver hed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That many high regards and reasons gainst her red.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then gan Authority her to appose</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With peremptorie powre, that made all mute;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then the Law of Nations gainst her rose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And reasons brought that no man could refute:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Next gan Religion gainst her to impute</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">High Gods beheast, and powre of holy lawes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then gan the Peoples cry and Commons sute</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Importune care of their owne publicke cause;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lastly Justice charged her with breach of lawes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But then, for her, on the contrarie part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rose many advocates for her to plead:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">First there came Pittie with full tender hart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with her joyn’d Regard of womanhead;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then came Daunger, threatning hidden dread</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And high alliance unto forren powre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then came Nobilitie of birth, that bread</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Great ruth through her misfortunes tragicke stowre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lastly Griefe did plead, and many teares forth powre.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With the neare touch whereof in tender hart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Briton Prince was sore empassionate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And woxe inclined much unto her part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through the sad terror of so dreadfull fate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wretched ruine of so high estate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That for great ruth his courage gan relent:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which when as Zele perceived to abate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He gan his earnest fervour to augment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And many fearefull objects to them to present.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He gan t’efforce the evidence anew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And new accusements to produce in place:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He brought forth that old hag of hellish hew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The cursed Ate, brought her face to face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who privie was and partie in the case:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She, glad of spoyle and ruinous decay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did her appeach; and, to her more disgrace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The plot of all her practise did display,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all her traynes and all her treasons forth did lay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then brought he forth with griesly grim aspect</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Abhorred Murder, who, with bloudie knyfe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet dropping fresh in hand, did her detect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And there with guiltie bloudshed charged ryfe:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then brought he forth Sedition, breeding stryfe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In troublous wits, and mutinous uprore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then brought he forth Incontinence of lyfe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even foule Adulterie her face before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lewd Impietie, that her accused sore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All which when as the Prince had heard and scene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His former fancies ruth he gan repent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from her partie eftsoones was drawen cleene:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Artegall, with constant firme intent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For zeale of Justice, was against her bent:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So was she guiltie deemed of them all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then Zele began to urge her punishment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to their Queene for judgement loudly call,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto Mercilla myld, for Justice gainst the thrall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But she, whose Princely brest was touched nere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With piteous ruth of her so wretched plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Though plaine she saw, by all that she did heare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That she of death was guiltie found by right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet would not let just vengeance on her light;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But rather let, instead thereof, to fall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Few perling drops from her faire lampes of light;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which she covering with her purple pall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would have the passion hid, and up arose withall.</span>

					<span>Some Clarkes doe doubt in their devicefull art</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whether this heavenly thing whereof I treat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To weeten Mercie, be of Justice part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or drawne forth from her by divine extreate:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This well I wote, that sure she is as great,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And meriteth to have as high a place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sith in th’Almighties everlasting seat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She first was bred, and borne of heavenly race,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From thence pour’d down on men by influence of grace.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For if that Vertue be of so great might</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which from just verdict will for nothing start,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But to preserve inviolated right</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Oft spilles the principall to save the part;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So much more, then, is that of powre and art</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That seekes to save the subject of her skill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet never doth from doome of right depart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As it is greater prayse to save then spill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And better to reforme then to cut off the ill.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who then can thee, Mercilla, throughly prayse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That herein doest all earthly Princes pas?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What heavenly Muse shall thy great honour rayse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up to the skies, whence first deriv’d it was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now on earth it selfe enlarged has</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From th’utmost brinke of the Armericke shore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the margent of the Molucas?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those Nations farre thy justice doe adore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But thine owne people do thy mercy prayse much more.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Much more it praysed was of those two knights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The noble Prince and righteous Artegall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When they had scene and heard her doome a-rights</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against Duessa, damned by them all;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But by her tempred without griefe or gall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till strong constraint did her thereto enforce:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And yet even then ruing her wilfull fall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With more then needfull naturall remorse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yeelding the last honour to her wretched corse.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>During all which, those knights continu’d there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both doing and receiving curtesies</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that great Ladie, who with goodly chere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Them entertayn’d, fit for their dignities,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Approving dayly to their noble eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Royall examples of her mercies rare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And worthie paterns of her clemencies;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which till this day mongst many living are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who them to their posterities doe still declare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Amongst the rest, which in that space befell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There came two Springals of full tender yeares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Farre thence from forrein land where they did dwell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To seeke for succour of her and her Peares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With humble prayers and intreatfull teares;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sent by their mother, who, a widow, was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wrapt in great dolours and in deadly feares</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By a strong Tyrant, who invaded has</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her land, and slaine her children ruefully, alas!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Her name was Belgae; who in former age</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A Ladie of great worth and wealth had beene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And mother of a frutefull heritage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even seventeene goodly sonnes; which who had scene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In their first flowre, before this fatall teene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Them overtooke and their faire blossomes blasted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More happie mother would her surely weene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then famous Niobe, before she tasted</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Latonaes childrens wrath that all her issue wasted,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But this fell Tyrant, through his tortious powre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had left her now but five of all that brood:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For twelve of them he did by times devoure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to his Idols sacrifice their blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whylest he of none was stopped nor withstood:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For soothly he was one of matchlesse might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of horrible aspecl and dreadfull mood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And had three bodies in one wast empight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And th’armes and legs of three to succour him in fight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And sooth they say that he was borne and bred</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Gyants race, the sonne of Geryon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He that whylome in Spaine so sore was dred</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For his huge powre and great oppression,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which brought that land to his subjection,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through his three bodies powre in one combynd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke all strangers, in that region</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Arry ving, to his kyne for food assynd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fayrest kyne alive, but of the fiercest kynd:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For they were all, they say, of purple hew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Kept by a cowheard, hight Eurytion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A cruell carle, the which all strangers slew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne day nor night did sleepe t’attend them on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But walkt about them ever and anone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With his two-headed dogge that Orthrus hight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Orthrus begotten by great Typhaon</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And foule Echidna in the house of night:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Hercules them all did overcome in fight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His sonne was this Geryoneo hight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, after that his monstrous father fell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under Alcides club, streight tooke his flight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From that sad land where he his syre did quell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And came to this, where Beige then did dwell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And flourish in all wealth and happinesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Being then new made widow (as befell)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After her Noble husbands late decesse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which gave beginning to her woe and wretchednesse.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then this bold Tyrant, of her widowhed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Taking advantage, and her yet fresh woes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Himselfe and service to her offered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her to defend against all forrein foes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That should their powre against her right oppose:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereof she glad, now needing strong defence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him entertayn’d and did her champion chose;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which long he usd with carefull diligence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The better to confirme her fearelesse confidence.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>By meanes whereof she did at last commit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All to his hands, and gave him soveraine powre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To doe whatever he thought good or fit:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which having got, he gan forth from that howre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To stirre up strife and many a tragicke stowre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Giving her dearest children one by one</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto a dreadfull Monster to devoure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And setting up an Idole of his owne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The image of his monstrous parent Geryone.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So tyrannizing and oppressing all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The woefull widow had no meanes now left,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But unto gratious great Mercilla call</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For ayde against that cruell Tyrants theft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere all her children he from her had reft:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore these two, her eldest sonnes, she sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To seeke for succour of this Ladies gieft;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom their sute they humbly did present</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In th’ hearing of full many Knights and Ladies gent.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Amongst the which then fortuned to bee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The noble Briton Prince with his brave Peare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who when he none of all those knights did see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hastily bent that enterprise to heare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor undertake the same for cowheard feare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He stepped forth with courage bold and great,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Admyr’d of all the rest in presence there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And humbly gan that mightie Queene entreat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To graunt him that adventure for his former feat.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She gladly graunted it: then he straightway</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Himselfe unto his journey gan prepare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all his armours readie dight that day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That nought the morrow next mote stay his fare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The morrow next appeared with purple hayre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet dropping fresh out of the Indian fount,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And bringing light into the heavens fayre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When he was readie to his steede to mount</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto his way, which now was all his care and count.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then taking humble leave of that great Queene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who gave him roiall giftes and riches rare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As tokens of her thankefull mind beseene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And leaving Artegall to his owne care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon his voyage forth he gan to fare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With those two gentle youthes, which him did guide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all his way before him still prepare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne after him did Artigall abide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But on his first adventure forward forth did ride.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It was not long till that the Prince arrived</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within the land where dwelt that Ladie sad;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereof that Tyrant had her now deprived,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And into moores and marshes banisht had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of the pleasant soyle and cities glad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which she wont to harbour happily:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But now his cruelty so sore she drad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That to those fennes for fastnesse she did fly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there her selfe did hyde from his hard tyranny.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There he her found in sorrow and dismay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All solitarie without living wight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For all her other children, through affray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had hid themselves, or taken further flight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke her selfe, through sudden strange affright</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When one in armes she saw, began to fly;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, when her owne two sonnes she had in sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She gan take hart and looke up joyfully;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For well she wist this knight came succour to supply.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And, running unto them with greedy joyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fell straight about their neckes as they did kneele,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And bursting forth in teares, “Ah! my sweet boyes,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(Sayd she) “yet now I gin new life to feele;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And feeble spirits, that gan faint and reele,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now rise againe at this your joyous sight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Alreadie seemes that fortunes headlong wheele</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Begins to turne, and sunne to shine more bright</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then it was wont, through comfort of this noble knight.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then turning unto him; “And you, Sir knight,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(Said she) “that taken have this toylesome paine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For wretched woman, miserable wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">May you in heaven immortall guerdon gaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For so great travell as you doe sustaine!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For other meede may hope for none of mee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom nought else but bare life doth remaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that so wretched one, as ye do see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is liker lingring death then loathed life to bee.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Much was he moved with her piteous plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And low dismounting from his loftie steede</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gan to recomfort her all that he might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeking to drive away deepe-rooted dreede</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With hope of helpe in that her greatest neede.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So thence he wished her with him to wend</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto some place where they mote rest and feede,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And she take comfort which God now did send:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Good hart in evils doth the evils much amend.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Ay me!” (sayd she) “and whether shall I goe?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are not all places full of forraine powres?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My pallaces possessed of my foe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My cities sackt, and their sky-threating towres</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Raced and made smooth fields now full of flowres?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Onely these marishes and myrie bogs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which the fearefull ewftes do build their bowres,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yeeld me an hostry mongst the croking frogs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And harbour here in safety from those ravenous dogs.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Nathlesse,” (said he) “deare Ladie, with me goe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some place shall us receive and harbour yield;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If not, we will it force, maugre your foe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And purchase it to us with speare and shield:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And if all fayle, yet farewell open field;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The earth to all her creatures lodging lends.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With such his chearefull speaches he doth wield</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her mind so well, that to his will she bends;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, bynding up her locks and weeds, forth with him wends.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They came unto a Citie farre up land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which whylome that Ladies owne had bene;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But now by force extort out of her hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By her strong foe, who had defaced cleene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her stately towres and buildings sunny sheene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shut up her haven, mard her marchants trade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Robbed her people that full rich had beene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in her necke a Castle huge had made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The which did her commaund without needing perswade.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>That Castle was the strength of all that state,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Untill that state by strength was pulled downe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that same citie, so now ruinate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had bene the keye of all that kingdomes crowne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both goodly Castle, and both goodly Towne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till that th’offended heavens list to lowre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon their blisse, and balefull fortune frowne:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When those gainst states and kingdomes do conjure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who then can thinke their hedlong ruine to recure?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But he had brought it now in servile bond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And made it beare the yoke of Inquisition,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stryving long time in vaine it to withstond;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet glad at last to make most base submission,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And life enjoy for any composition:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So now he hath new lawes and orders new</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Imposd on it with many a hard condition,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And forced it, the honour that is dew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To God, to doe unto his Idole most untrew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To him he hath before this Castle greene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Built a faire Chappell, and an Altar framed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of costly Ivory full rich beseene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On which that cursed Idole, farre proclamed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He hath set up, and him his God hath named;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ofrring to him in sinfull sacrifice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The flesh of men, to Gods owne likenesse framed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And powring forth their bloud in brutishe wize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That any yron eyes to see it would agrize.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And, for more horror and more crueltie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under that cursed Idols altar-stone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An hideous monster doth in darknesse lie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose dreadfull shape was never scene of none</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That lives on earth; but unto those alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which unto him sacrificed bee:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those he devoures, they say, both flesh and bone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What else they have is all the Tyrants fee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that no whit of them remayning one may see.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There eke he placed a strong garrisone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And set a Seneschall of dreaded might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That by his powre oppressed every one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And vanquished all ventrous knights in fight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom he wont shew all the shame he might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After that them in battell he had wonne:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which when now they gan approch in sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Ladie counseld him the place to shonne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as so many knights had fouly bene fordonne.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Her fearefull speaches nought he did regard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, ryding streight under the Castle wall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Called aloud unto the watchfull ward</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which there did wayte, willing them forth to call</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the field their Tyrants Seneschall:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom when tydings thereof came, he streight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cals for his armes, and arming him withall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eftsoones forth pricked proudly in his might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gan with courage fierce addresse him to the fight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They both encounter in the middle plaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And their sharpe speares doe both together smite</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Amid their shields, with so huge might and maine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That seem’d their soules they wold have ryven quight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of their breasts with furious despight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet could the Seneschals no entrance find</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the Princes shield where it empight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(So pure the metall was and well refynd,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But shivered all about, and scattered in the wynd:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Not so the Princes, but with restlesse force</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into his shield it readie passage found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both through his haberjeon and eke his corse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which tombling downe upon the senselesse ground</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gave leave unto his ghost from thraldome bound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To wander in the griesly shades of night.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There did the Prince him leave in deadly swound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thence unto the castle marched right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see if entrance there as yet obtaine he might.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, as he nigher drew, three knights he spyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All arm’d to point, issuing forth apace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which towards him with all their powre did ryde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And meeting him right in the middle race</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did all their speares attonce on him enchace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As three great Culverings for battrie bent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And leveld all against one certaine place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doe all attonce their thunders rage forth rent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That makes the wals to stagger with astonishment:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So all attonce they on the Prince did thonder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who from his saddle swarved nought asyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne to their force gave way, that was great wonder;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But like a bulwarke firmely did abyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rebutting him, which in the midst did ryde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With so huge rigour, that his mortall speare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Past through his shield and pierst through either syde;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That downe he fell uppon his mother deare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And powred forth his wretched life in deadly dreare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whom when his other fellowes saw, they fled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As fast as feete could carry them away;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And after them the Prince as swiftly sped,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be aveng’d of their unknightly play.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There, whilest they entring th’one did th’other stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The hindmost in the gate he overhent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, as he pressed in, him there did slay:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His carkasse, tumbling on the threshold, sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His groning soule unto her place of punishment.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The other which was entred laboured fast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To sperre the gate; but that same lumpe of clay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose grudging ghost was thereout fled and past,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Right in the middest of the threshold lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it the Posterne did from closing stay:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whiles the Prince hard preased in betweene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And entraunce wonne: Streight th’other fled away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ran into the Hall, where he did weene</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Him selfe to save; but he there slew him at the skreene.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then all the rest which in that Castle were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeing that sad ensample them before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Durst not abide, but fled away for feare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And them convayd out at a Posterne dore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Long sought the Prince; but when he found no more</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">T’oppose against his powre he forth issued</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto that Lady, where he her had lore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And her gan cheare with what she there had vewed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what she had not scene within unto her shewed:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who with right humble thankes him goodly greeting</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For so great prowesse as he there had proved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Much greater then was ever in her weeting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With great admiraunce inwardly was moved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And honourd him with all that her behoved.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thenceforth into that Castle he her led</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With her two sonnes, right deare of her beloved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where all that night them selves they cherished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And from her balefull minde all care he banished.</span>

					<span class="i1">Ne stayed step, till that he came at last</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the Castle which they conquerd had:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There with huge terrour, to be more ydrad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He sternely marcht before the Castle gate,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Deliver him his owne, ere yet too late,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To which they had no right, nor any wrongfull state.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Prince staid not his aunswere to devize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, opening streight the Sparre, forth to him came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full nobly mounted in right warlike wize;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And asked him, if that he were the same,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who all that wrong unto that wofull Dame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So long had done, and from her native land</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Exiled her, that all the world spake shame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He boldly aunswerd him, He there did stand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That would his doings justifie with his owne hand.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that so furiously at him he flew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if he would have over-run him streight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with his huge great yron axe gan hew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So hideously uppon his armour bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he to peeces would have chopt it quight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the bold Prince was forced foote to give</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To his first rage, and yeeld to his despight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whilest at him so dreadfully he drive,</span>

					<span class="i1">Besides the double strength which in them was:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For stil, when fit occasion did betyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He could his weapon shift from side to syde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From hand to hand; and with such nimblesse sly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could wield about, that, ere it were espide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The wicked stroke did wound his enemy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behinde, beside, before, as he it list apply.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which uncouth use when as the Prince perceived,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He gan to watch the wielding of his hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Least by such slight he were unwares deceived;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ever, ere he saw the stroke to land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He would it meete and warily withstand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One time when he his weapon faynd to shift,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he was wont, and chang’d from hand to hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He met him with a counterstroke so swift,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That quite smit off his arme as he it up did lift.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Therewith all fraught with fury and disdaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He brayd aloud for very fell despight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sodainely, t’avenge him selfe againe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gan into one assemble all the might</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all his hands, and heaved them on hight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thinking to pay him with that one for all:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But the sad steele seizd not, where it was hight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uppon the childe, but somewhat short did fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lighting on his horses head him quite did mall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Downe streight to ground fell his astonisht steed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke to th’earth his burden with him bare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he him selfe full lightly from him freed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gan him selfe to fight on foote prepare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereof when as the Gyant was aware,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He wox right blyth, as he had got thereby,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And laught so loud, that all his teeth wide bare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One might have scene enraung’d disorderly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like to a rancke of piles that pitched are awry.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Eftsoones againe his axe he raught on hie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere he were throughly buckled to his geare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And can let drive at him so dreadfullie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That had he chaunced not his shield to reare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere that huge stroke arrived on him neare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He had him surely cloven quite in twaine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But th’Adamantine shield which he did beare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So well was tempred, that for all his maine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It would no passage yeeld unto his purpose vaine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet was the stroke so forcibly applide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That made him stagger with uncertaine sway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if he would have tottered to one side:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherewith full wroth he fiercely gan assay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That curt’sie with like kindnesse to repay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And smote at him with so importune might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That two more of his armes did fall away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like fruitlesse braunches, which the hatchets slight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath pruned from the native tree, and cropped quight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that all mad and furious he grew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like a fell mastiffe through enraging heat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And curst, and band, and blasphemies forth threw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against his Gods, and fire to them did threat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hell unto him selfe with horrour great.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thenceforth he car’d no more which way he strooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor where it light; but gan to chaufe and sweat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gnasht his teeth, and his head at him shooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sternely him beheld with grim and ghastly looke.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nought fear’d the childe his lookes, ne yet his threats,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But onely wexed now the more aware</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To save him selfe from those his furious heats,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And watch advauntage how to worke his care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which good Fortune to him offred faire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For as he in his rage him overstrooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He, ere he could his weapon backe repaire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His side all bare and naked overtooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with his mortal steel quite through the body strooke.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Through all three bodies he him strooke attonce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all the three attonce fell on the plaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Else should he thrise have needed for the nonce</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Them to have stricken, and thrise to have slaine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So now all three one sencelesse lumpe remaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Enwallow’d in his owne blacke bloudy gore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And byting th’earth for very deaths disdaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, with a cloud of night him covering, bore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Downe to the house of dole, his daies there to deplore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when the Lady from the Castle saw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where she with her two sonnes did looking stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She towards him in hast her selfe did draw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To greet him the good fortune of his hand:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the people, both of towne and land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which there stood gazing from the Citties wall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uppon these warriours, greedy t’understand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whether should the victory befall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now when they saw it falne, they eke him greeted all.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Beige, with her sonnes, prostrated low</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before his feete in all that peoples sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mongst joyes mixing some tears, mongst wele some wo,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him thus bespake: “O most redoubted Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which hast me, of all most wretched wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That earst was dead, restor’d to life againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And these weake impes replanted by thy might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What guerdon can I give thee for thy paine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But even that which thou savedst thine still to remaine?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He tooke her up forby the lilly hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And her recomforted the best he might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying; “Deare Lady, deedes ought not be scand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By th’authors manhood, nor the doers might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But by their trueth and by the causes right:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That same is it which fought for you this day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What other meed, then, need me to requight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that which yeeldeth vertues meed alway?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is, the vertue selfe, which her reward doth pay.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She humbly thankt him for that wondrous grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And further sayd: “Ah! Sir, but mote ye please,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sith ye thus farre have tendred my poore case,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As from my chiefest foe me to release,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That your victorious arme will not yet cease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till ye have rooted all the relickes out</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that vilde race, and stablished my peace.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“What is there else” (sayd he) “left of their rout?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Declare it boldly, Dame, and doe not stand in dout.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Then wote you, Sir, that in this Church hereby</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There stands an Idole of great note and name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which this Gyant reared first on hie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of his owne vaine fancies thought did frame:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom, for endlesse horrour of his shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He offred up for daily sacrifize</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My children and my people, burnt in flame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With all the tortures that he could devize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The more t’aggrate his God with such his blouddy guize.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“And underneath this Idoll there doth lie</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An hideous monster that doth it defend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And feedes on all the carkasses that die</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In sacrifize unto that cursed feend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose ugly shape none ever saw, nor kend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ever scap’d: for of a man, they say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It has the voice, that speaches forth doth send,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even blasphemous words, which she doth bray</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of her poysnous entrails fraught with dire decay.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when the Prince heard tell, his heart gan earne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For great desire that Monster to assay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And prayd the place of her abode to learne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which being shew’d, he gan him selfe streightway</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereto addresse, and his bright shield display.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So to the Church he came, where it was told</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Monster underneath the Altar lay:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There he that Idoll saw of massy gold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Most richly made, but there no Monster did behold.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Upon the Image with his naked blade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Three times, as in defiance, there he strooke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the third time out of an hidden shade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There forth issewd from under th’Altars smooke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A dreadfull feend with fowle deformed looke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That stretcht it selfe as it had long lyen still;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And her long taile and fethers strongly shooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all the Temple did with terrour fill;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet him nought terrified that feared nothing ill.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>An huge great Beast it was, when it in length</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was stretched forth, that nigh fild all the place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And seem’d to be of infinite great strength:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Horrible, hideous, and of hellish race,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Borne of the brooding of Echidna base,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or other like infernall furies kinde;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For of a Mayd she had the outward face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To hide the horrour which did lurke behinde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The better to beguile whom she so fond did finde.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thereto the body of a dog she had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full of fell ravin and fierce greedinesse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A Lions clawes, with powre and rigour clad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To rend and teare what so she can oppresse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A Dragons taile, whose sting without redresse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full deadly wounds where so it is empight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Eagles wings, for scope and speedinesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That nothing may escape her reaching might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereto she ever list to make her hardy flight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Much like in foulnesse and deformity</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto that Monster, whom the Theban Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The father of that fatall progeny,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made kill her selfe for very hearts despight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he had red her Riddle, which no wight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could ever loose but suffred deadly doole:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So also did this Monster use like slight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To many a one which came unto her schoole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whom she did put to death, deceived like a foole.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She comming forth, when as she first beheld</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The armed Prince with shield so blazing bright</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her ready to assaile, was greatly queld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And much dismayd with that dismayfull sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That backe she would have turnd for great affright:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he gan her with courage fierce assay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That forst her turne againe in her despight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To save her selfe, least that he did her slay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sure he had her slaine, had she not turnd her way.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tho, when she saw that she was forst to fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She flew at him like to an hellish feend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on his shield tooke hold with all her might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if that it she would in peeces rend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or reave out of the hand that did it hend:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Strongly he strove out of her greedy gripe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To loose his shield, and long while did contend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, when he could not quite it, with one stripe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her Lions clawes he from her feete away did wipe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With that aloude she gan to bray and yell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fowle blasphemous speaches forth did cast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And bitter curses, horrible to tell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That even the Temple, wherein she was plast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did quake to heare, and nigh asunder brast:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tho with her huge long taile she at him strooke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That made him stagger and stand halfe agast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With trembling joynts, as he for terrour shooke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who nought was terrifide, but greater courage tooke.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As when the Mast of some well-timbred hulke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is with the blast of some outragious storme</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Blowne downe, it shakes the bottome of the bulke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And makes her ribs to cracke as they were torne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whilest still she stands, as stonisht and forlorne:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So was he stound with stroke of her huge taile;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, ere that it she backe againe had borne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He with his sword it strooke, that without faile</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He jointed it, and mard the swinging of her flaile.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then gan she cry much louder then afore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all the people there without it heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Beige selfe was therewith stonied sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if the onely sound thereof she feard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But then the feend her selfe more fiercely reard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uppon her wide great wings, and strongly flew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With all her body at his head and beard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That had he not foreseene with heedfull vew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thrown his shield atween, she had him done to rew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, as she prest on him with heavy sway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under her wombe his fatall sword he thrust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And for her entrailes made an open way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To issue forth; the which, once being brust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like to a great Mill-damb forth fiercely gusht,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And powred out of her infernall sinke</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Most ugly filth; and poyson therewith rusht,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That him nigh choked with the deadly stinke.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such loathly matter were small lust to speake or thinke.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then downe to ground fell that deformed Masse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Breathing out clouds of sulphure fowle and blacke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which a puddle of contagion was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More loathd then Lerna, or then Stygian lake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That any man would nigh awhaped make:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom when he saw on ground, he was full glad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And streight went forth his gladnesse to partake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With Beige, who watcht all this while full sad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wayting what end would be of that same daunger drad.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whom when she saw so joyously come forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She gan rejoyce and shew triumphant chere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lauding and praysing his renowmed worth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By all the names that honorable were.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then in he brought her, and her shewed there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The present of his paines, that Monsters spoyle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke that Idoll deem’d so costly dere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom he did all to peeces breake, and foyle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In filthy durt, and left so in the loathely soyle.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then all the people which beheld that day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gan shout aloud, that unto heaven it rong;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the damzels of that towne in ray</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Come dauncing forth, and joyous carrols song:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So him they led through all their streetes along</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Crowned with girlonds of immortall baies;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the vulgar did about them throng</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see the man, whose everlasting praise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They all were bound to all posterities to raise.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There he with Belgas did awhile remaine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Making great feast and joyous merriment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Untill he had her settled in her raine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With safe assuraunce and establishment:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then to his first emprize his mind he lent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full loath to Belgas and to all the rest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of whom yet taking leave thence forth he went,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to his former journey him addrest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On which long way he rode, ne ever day did rest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But turne we now to noble Artegall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, having left Mercilla, streight way went</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On his first quest, the which him forth did call,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To weet, to worke Irenaes franchisement,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke Grantortoes worthy punishment.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So forth he fared, as his manner was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With onely Talus wayting diligent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through many perils; and much way did pas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till nigh unto the place at length approcht he has.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There as he traveld by the way, he met</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An aged wight wayfaring all alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who through his yeares long since aside had set</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The use of armes, and battell quite forgone:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom as he approcht, he knew anone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it was he which whilome did attend</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On faire Irene in her affliction,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When first to Faery court he saw her wend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto his soveraine Queene her suite for to commend.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whom by his name saluting, thus he gan:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Haile, good Sir Sergis, truest Knight alive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well tride in all thy Ladies troubles than</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When her that Tyrant did of Crowne deprive;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What new occasion doth thee hither drive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whiles she alone is left, and thou here found?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or is she thrall, or doth she not survive?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom he thus: “She liveth sure and sound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But by that Tyrant is in wretched thraldome bound:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“For she presuming on th’appointed tyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which ye promist, as ye were a Knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To meete her at the salvage Hands syde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then and there for triall of her right</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With her unrighteous enemy to fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did thither come; where she, afrayd of nought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By guilefull treason and by subtill slight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Surprized was, and to Grantorto brought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who her imprisond hath, and her life often sought.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“And now he hath to her prefixt a day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By which if that no champion doe appeare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which will her cause in battailous array</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against him justifie, and prove her cleare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all those crimes that he gainst her doth reare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She death shall sure aby.” Those tidings sad</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did much abash Sir Artegall to heare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And grieved sore that through his fault she had</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fallen into that Tyrants hand and usage bad.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then thus replide: “Now sure and by my life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Too much am I to blame for that faire Maide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That have her drawne to all this troublous strife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through promise to afford her timely aide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which by default I have not yet defraide:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But witnesse unto me, ye heavens! that know</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How cleare I am from blame of this upbraide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For ye into like thraldome me did throw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And kept from complishing the faith which I did owe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But now aread, Sir Sergis, how long space</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hath he her lent a Champion to provide?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Ten daies,” (quoth he) “he graunted hath of grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For that he weeneth well before that tide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">None can have tidings to assist her side:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For all the shores, which to the sea accoste,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He day and night doth ward both farre and wide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That none can there arrive without an hoste:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So her he deemes already but a damned ghoste.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Now turne againe,” (Sir Artegall then sayd)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“For, if I live till those ten daies have end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Assure your selfe, Sir Knight, she shall have ayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Though I this dearest life for her doe spend.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So backeward he attone with him did wend:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tho, as they rode together on their way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A rout of people they before them kend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Flocking together in confusde array;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if that there were some tumultuous affray.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To which as they approcht the cause to know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They saw a Knight in daungerous distresse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of a rude rout him chasing to and fro,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That sought with lawlesse powre him to oppresse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And bring in bondage of their brutishnesse:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And farre away, amid their rakehell bands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They spide a Lady left all succourlesse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Crying, and holding up her wretched hands</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To him for aide, who long in vaine their rage withstands.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet still he strives, ne any perill spares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To reskue her from their rude violence;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And like a Lion wood amongst them fares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dealing his dreadfull blowes with large dispence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gainst which the pallid death findes no defence;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But all in vaine: their numbers are so great,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That naught may boot to banishe them from thence;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For soone as he their outrage backe doth beat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They turne afresh, and oft renew their former threat.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And now they doe so sharpely him assay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That they his shield in peeces battred have,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And forced him to throw it quite away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fro dangers dread his doubtfull life to save;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Albe that it most safety to him gave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And much did magnifie his noble name:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For, from the day that he thus did it leave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Amongst all Knights he blotted was with blame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And counted but a recreant Knight with endles shame.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whom when they thus distressed did behold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They drew unto his aide; but that rude rout</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Them also gan assaile with outrage bold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And forced them, how ever strong and stout</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They were, as well approv’d in many a doubt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Backe to recule; untill that yron man</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With his huge flaile began to lay about;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From whose sterne presence they diffused ran,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like scattred chaffe the which the wind away doth fan.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So when that Knight from perill cleare was freed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He drawing neare began to greete them faire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And yeeld great thankes for their so goodly deed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In saving him from daungerous despaire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of those which sought his life for to empaire:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of whom Sir Artegall gan then enquire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whole occasion of his late misfare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And who he was, and what those villaines were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The which with mortall malice him pursu’d so nere.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To whom he thus: “My name is Burbon hight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well knowne, and far renowmed heretofore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Untill late mischiefe did uppon me light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all my former praise hath blemisht sore:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that faire Lady, which in that uprore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ye with those caytives saw, Flourdelis hight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is mine owne love, though me she have forlore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whether withheld from me by wrongfull might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or with her owne good will, I cannot read aright.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But sure to me her faith she first did plight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be my love, and take me for her Lord;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till that a Tyrant, which Grandtorto hight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With golden giftes and many a guilefull word</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Entyced her to him for to accord.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O! who may not with gifts and words be tempted?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sith which she hath me ever since abhord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to my foe hath guilefully consented:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ay me, that ever guyle in wemen was invented!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“And now he hath this troupe of villains sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By open force to fetch her quite away:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gainst whom my selfe I long in vaine have bent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To rescue her, and daily meanes assay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet rescue her thence by no meanes I may,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For they doe me with multitude oppresse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with unequall might doe overlay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That oft I driven am to great distresse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forced to forgoe th’attempt remedilesse.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But why have ye” (said Artegall) “forborne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Your owne good shield in daungerous dismay?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That is the greatest shame and foulest scorne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which unto any knight behappen may,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To loose the badge that should his deedes display.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom Sir Burbon, blushing halfe for shame:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“That shall I unto you” (quoth he) “bewray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Least ye therefore mote happily me blame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And deeme it doen of will, that through inforcement came.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“True is that I at first was dubbed knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By a good knight, the knight of the Redcrosse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, when he gave me armes in field to fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gave me a shield, in which he did endosse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His deare Redeemers badge upon the bosse:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The same long while I bore, and therewithall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fought many battels without wound or losse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therewith Grandtorto selfe I did appall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And made him oftentimes in field before me fall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But for that many did that shield envie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And cruell enemies increased more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To stint all strife and troublous enmitie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That bloudie scutchin, being battered sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I layd aside, and have of late forbore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hoping thereby to have my love obtayned;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet can I not my love have nathemore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For she by force is still fro me detayned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with corruptfull brybes is to untruth mis-trayned.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To whom thus Artegall: “Certes, Sir knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hard is the case the which ye doe complaine?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet not so hard (for nought so hard may light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it to such a streight mote you constraine)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As to abandon that which doth containe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Your honours stile, that is, your warlike shield.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All perill ought be lesse, and lesse all paine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then losse of fame in disaventrous field:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dye, rather then doe ought that mote dishonour yield/</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Not so,” (quoth he) “for yet, when time doth serve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My former shield I may resume againe:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To temporize is not from truth to swerve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne for advantage terme to entertaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When as necessitie doth it constraine.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Fie on such forgerie!” (sayd Artegall)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Under one hood to shadow faces twaine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Knights ought be true, and truth is one in all:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all things, to dissemble, fouly may befall!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Yet let me you of courtesie request”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(Said Burbon) “to assist me now at need</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against these pesants which have me opprest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And forced me to so infamous deed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That yet my love may from their hands be freed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sir Artegall, albe he earst did wyte</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His wavering mind, yet to his aide agreed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, buckling him eftsoones unto the fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did set upon those troupes with all his powre and might.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who flocking round about them, as a swarme</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of flyes upon a birchen bough doth cluster,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did them assault with terrible allarme;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And over all the fields themselves did muster,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With bils and glayves making a dreadfull luster,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That forst at first those knights backe to retyre:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As when the wrathfull Boreas doth bluster,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nought may abide the tempest of his yre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both man and beast doe fly, and succour doe inquyre.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, when as overblowen was that brunt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those knights began afresh them to assayle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all about the fields like Squirrels hunt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But chiefly Talus with his yron flayle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gainst which no flight nor rescue mote avayle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made cruell havocke of the baser crew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And chaced them both over hill and dale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The raskall manie soone they overthrew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the two knights themselves their captains did subdew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At last they came whereas that Ladie bode,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom now her keepers had forsaken quight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To save themselves, and scattered were abrode.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her halfe dismayd they found in doubtfull plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As neither glad nor sorie for their sight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet wondrous faire she was, and richly clad</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In roiall robes, and many jewels dight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that those villens through their usage bad</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Them fouly rent, and shamefully defaced had.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Burbon, streight dismounting from his steed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto her ran with greedie great desyre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And catching her fast by her ragged weed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would have embraced her with hart entyre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But she backstarting with disdainefull yre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bad him avaunt, ne would unto his lore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Allured be for prayer nor for meed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom when those knights so froward and forlore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beheld, they her rebuked and upbrayded sore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sayd Artegall: “What foule disgrace is this</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To so faire Ladie, as ye seeme in sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To blot your beautie, that unblemisht is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With so foule blame as breach of faith once plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or change of love for any worlds delight!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is ought on earth so pretious or deare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As prayse and honour? Or is ought so bright</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And beautifull as glories beames appeare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose goodly light then Phoebus lampe doth shine more cleare?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Why then will ye, fond Dame, attempted bee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto a strangers love, so lightly placed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For guiftes of gold or any worldly glee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To leave the love that ye before embraced,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And let your fame with falshood be defaced?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fie on the pelfe for which good name is sold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And honour with indignitie debased!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dearer is love then life, and fame then gold;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But dearer then them both your faith once plighted hold.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Much was the Ladie in her gentle mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Abasht at his rebuke, that bit her neare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ought to answere thereunto did find;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, hanging down her head with heavie cheare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stood long amaz’d as she amated weare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which Burbon seeing her againe assayd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, clasping twixt his armes, her up did reare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon his steede, whiles she no whit gainesayd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So bore her quite away, nor well nor ill apayd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nathlesse the yron man did still pursew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That raskall many with unpitied spoyle;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ceassed not, till all their scattred crew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the sea he drove quite from that soyle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which they troubled had with great turmoyle.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Artegall, seeing his cruell deed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Commaunded him from slaughter to recoyle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to his voyage gan againe proceed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that the terme, approching fast, required speed.</span>

					<span>O sacred hunger of ambitious mindes,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Gainst whom Sir Artegall, long having since</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Taken in hand th’exploit, (being theretoo</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Appointed by that mightie Faerie Prince,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Great Gloriane, that Tyrant to fordoo,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through other great adventures hethertoo</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had it forslackt: But now time drawing ny</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To him assynd her high beheast to doo,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To the sea-shore he gan his way apply,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To weete if shipping readie he mote there descry.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tho when they came to the sea coast they found</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A ship all readie (as good fortune fell)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To put to sea, with whom they did compound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To passe them over where them list to tell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The winde and weather served them so well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in one day they with the coast did fall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereas they readie found, them to rep ell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Great hostes of men in order martiall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which them forbad to land, and footing did forstall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But nathemore would they from land refraine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, when as nigh unto the shore they drew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That foot of man might sound the bottome plaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Talus into the sea did forth issew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Though darts from shore and stones they at him threw;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wading through the waves with stedfast sway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Maugre the might of all those troupes in vew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did win the shore; whence he them chast away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And made to fly like doves whom the Eagle doth affray.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The whyles Sir Artegall with that old knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did forth descend, there being none them neare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And forward marched to a towne in sight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By this came tydings to the Tyrants eare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By those which earst did fly away for feare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of their arrival: wherewith troubled sore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He all his forces streight to him did reare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And forth issuing with his scouts afore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Meant them to have encountred ere they left the shore:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But ere he marched farre he with them met,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fiercely charged them with all his force:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Talus sternely did upon them set,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And brusht and battred them without remorse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That on the ground he left full many a corse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne any able was him to withstand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he them overthrew both man and horse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That they lay scattred over all the land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As thicke as doth the seede after the sowers hand:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Till Artegall him seeing so to rage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Willd him to stay, and signe of truce did make:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which all harkning did a while asswage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their forces furie, and their terror slake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till he an Herauld cald, and to him spake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Willing him wend unto the Tyrant streight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And tell him that not for such slaughters sake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He thether came, but for to trie the right</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of fayre Irenaes cause with him in single fight:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And willed him for to reclayme with speed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His scattred people, ere they all were slaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And time and place convenient to areed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which they two the combat might darraine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which message when Grantorto heard, full fayne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And glad he was the slaughter so to stay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And pointed for the combat twixt them twayne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The morrow next, ne gave him longer day:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So sounded the retraite, and drew his folke away.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>That night Sir Artegall did cause his tent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There to be pitched on the open plaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For he had given streight commaundement</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That none should dare him once to entertaine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which none durst breake, though many would right faine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For faire Irena, whom they loved deare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But yet old Sergis did so well him paine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That from close friends, that dar’d not to appeare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He all things did purvay which for them needfull weare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The morrow next, that was the dismall day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Appointed for Irenas death before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So soone as it did to the world display</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His chearefull face, and light to men restore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The heavy Mayd, to whom none tydings bore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Artegals arryvall her to free,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lookt up with eyes full sad and hart full sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Weening her lifes last howre then neare to bee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sith no redemption nigh she did not heare nor see.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then up she rose, and on her selfe did dight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Most squalid garments, fit for such a day;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with dull countenance and with doleful spright</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She forth was brought in sorrowfull dismay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For to receive the doome of her decay:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But comming to the place, and finding there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sir Artegall, in battailous array</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wayting his foe, it did her dead hart cheare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And new life to her lent in midst of deadly feare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like as a tender Rose in open plaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with untimely drought nigh withered was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hung the head, soone as few drops of raine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereon distill and deaw her daintie face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gins to looke up, and with fresh wonted grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dispreds the glorie of her leaves gay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such was Irenas countenance, such her case,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When Artegall she saw in that array,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There wayting for the Tyrant till it was farre day.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who came at length with proud presumpteous gate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the field, as if he fearelesse were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All armed in a cote of yron plate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of great defence to ward the deadly feare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on his head a steele-cap he did weare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of colour rustie-browne, but sure and strong;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in his hand an huge Polaxe did beare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose steale was yron-studded, but not long,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With which he wont to fight to justifie his wrong:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Of stature huge and hideous he was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like to a Giant for his monstrous hight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And did in strength most sorts of men surpas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne ever any found his match in might;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereto he had great skill in single fight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His face was ugly and his countenance sterne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That could have frayd one with the very sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gaped like a gulfe when he did gerne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That whether man or monster one could scarse discerne.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Soone as he did within the listes appeare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With dreadfull looke he Artegall beheld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if he would have daunted him with feare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, grinning griesly, did against him weld</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His deadly weapon which in hand he held:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But th’ Elfin swayne, that oft had scene like sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was with his ghastly count’nance nothing queld;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But gan him streight to buckle to the fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cast his shield about to be in readie plight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The trompets sound, and they together goe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With dreadfull terror and with fell intent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And their huge strokes full daungerously bestow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To doe most dammage where as most they ment:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But with such force and furie violent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Tyrant thundred his thicke blowes so fast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That through the yron walles their way they rent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And even to the vitall parts they past,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne ought could them endure, but all they cleft or brast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which cruell outrage when as Artegall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did well avize, thenceforth with warie heed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He shund his strokes, where ever they did fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And way did give unto their gracelesse speed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As when a skilfull Marriner doth reed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A storme approching that doth perill threat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He will not bide the daunger of such dread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But strikes his sayles, and vereth his mainsheat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lends unto it leave the emptie ayre to beat.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So did the Faerie knight himselfe abeare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And stouped oft his head from shame to shield:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No shame to stoupe, ones head more high to reare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, much to gaine, alitle for to yield:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So stoutest knights doen oftentimes in field.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But still the tyrant sternely at him layd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And did his yron axe so nimbly wield,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That many wounds into his flesh it made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with his burdenous blowes him sore did overlade.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet when as fit advantage he did spy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whiles the cursed felon high did reare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His cruell hand to smite him mortally,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under his stroke he to him stepping neare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Right in the flanke him strooke with deadly dreare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the gore-bloud thence gushing grievously</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did underneath him like a pond appeare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all his armour did with purple dye:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereat he brayed loud, and yelled dreadfully.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet the huge stroke, which he before intended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Kept on his course as he did it direct,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with such monstrous poise adowne descended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That seemed nought could him from death protect;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he it well did ward with wise respect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And twixt him and the blow his shield did cast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which thereon seizing tooke no great effect;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, byting deepe therein did sticke so fast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That by no meanes it backe againe he forth could wrast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Long while he tug’d and strove to get it out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all his powre applyed thereunto,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he therewith the knight drew all about:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nathlesse, for all that ever he could doe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His axe he could not from his shield undoe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which Artegall perceiving strooke no more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But loosing soone his shield did it forgoe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, whiles he combred was therewith so sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He gan at him let drive more fiercely then afore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So well he him pursew’d, that at the last</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He stroke him with Chrysaor on the hed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with the souse thereof full sore aghast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He staggered to and fro in doubtfull sted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Againe, whiles he him saw so ill bested,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He did him smite with all his might and maine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, falling, on his mother earth he fed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom when he saw prostrated on the plaine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He lightly reft his head to ease him of his paine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which when the people round about him saw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They shouted all for joy of his successe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Glad to be quit from that proud Tyrants awe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which with strong powre did them long time oppresse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, running all with greedie joyfulnesse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To faire Irena, at her feet did fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And her adored with due humblenesse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As their true Liege and Princesse naturall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke her champions glorie sounded over all.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who streight her leading with meete majestic</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the pallace where their kings did rayne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did her therein establish peaceablie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to her kingdomes seat restore agayne:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all such persons, as did late maintayne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Tyrants part with close or open ayde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He sorely punished with heavie payne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in short space, whiles there with her he stayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not one was left that durst her once have disobayd.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>During which time that he did there remayne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His studie was true Justice how to deale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And day and night employ’d his busie paine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How to reforme that ragged common-weale:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that same yron man, which could reveale</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All hidden crimes, through all that realme he sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To search out those that usd to rob and steale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or did rebell gainst lawfull government;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On whom he did inflict most grievous punishment.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, ere he coulde reforme it thoroughly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He through occasion called was away</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To Faerie Court, that of necessity</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His course of Justice he was forst to stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Talus to revoke from the right way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which he was that Realme for to redresse:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But envies cloud still dimmeth vertues ray.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So, having freed Irena from distresse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He tooke his leave of her there left in heavinesse.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tho, as he backe returned from that land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And there arriv’d againe whence forth he set,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He had not passed farre upon the strand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When as two old ill favour’d Hags he met,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By the way side being together set;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Two griesly creatures: and, to that their faces</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Most foule and filthie were, their garments yet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Being all rag’d and tatter’d, their disgraces</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did much the more augment, and made most ugly cases.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The one of them, that elder did appeare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With her dull eyes did seeme to looke askew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That her mis-shape much helpt; and her foule heare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hung loose and loathsomely: Thereto her hew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was wan and leane, that all her teeth arew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all her bones might through her cheekes be red:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her lips were, like raw lether, pale and blew:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And as she spake therewith she slavered;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet spake she seldom, but thought more the lesse she sed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Her hands were foule and durtie, never washt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In all her life, with long nayles over-raught,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like puttocks clawes; with th’one of which she scracht</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her cursed head, although it itched naught:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The other held a snake with venime fraught,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On which she fed and gnawed hungrily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if that long she had not eaten ought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That round about her jawes one might descry</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bloudie gore and poyson dropping lothsomely.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Her name was Envie, knowen well thereby,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose nature is to grieve and grudge at all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ever she sees doen prays-worthily;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose sight to her is greatest crosse may fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And vexeth so that makes her eat her gall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For, when she wanteth other thing to eat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She feedes on her owne maw unnaturall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of her owne foule entrayles makes her meat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Meat fit for such a monsters monsterous dyeat:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And if she hapt of any good to heare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That had to any happily betid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then would she inly fret, and grieve, and teare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her flesh for felnesse, which she inward hid:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But if she heard of ill that any did,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or harme that any had, then would she make</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Great cheare, like one unto a banquet bid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in anothers losse great pleasure take,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As she had got thereby and gayned a great stake.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The other nothing better was then shee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Agreeing in bad will and cancred kynd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But in bad maner they did disagree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For what so Envie good or bad did fynd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She did conceale, and murder her owne mynd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But this, what ever evill she conceived,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did spred abroad and throw in th’open wynd:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet this in all her words might be perceived,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That all she sought was mens good name to have bereaved.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For, whatsoever good by any sayd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or doen she heard, she would streightwayes invent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How to deprave or slaunderously upbrayd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or to misconstrue of a mans intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And turne to ill the thing that well was ment:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore she used often to resort</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To common haunts, and companies frequent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To hearke what any one did good report,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To blot the same with blame, or wrest in wicked sort.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And if that any ill she heard of any,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She would it eeke, and make much worse by telling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And take great joy to publish it to many,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That every matter worse was for her melling:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her name was hight Detraction, and her dwelling</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was neare to Envie, even her neighbour next;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A wicked hag, and Envy selfe excelling</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In mischiefe; for her selfe she onely vext,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But this same both her selfe and others eke perplext.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Her face was ugly, and her mouth distort,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Foming with poyson round about her gils,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which her cursed tongue, full sharpe and short,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Appear’d like Aspis sting that closely kils,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or cruelly does wound whom so she wils:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A distaffe in her other hand she had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the which she litle spinnes, but spils;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And faynes to weave false tales and leasings bad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To throw amongst the good which others had disprad.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>These two now had themselves combynd in one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And linckt together gainst Sir Artegall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For whom they wayted as his mortall fone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How they might make him into mischiefe fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For freeing from their snares Irena thrall:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Besides, unto themselves they gotten had</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A monster, which the Blatant Beast men call,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A dreadfull feend, of gods and men ydrad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whom they by slights allur’d, and to their purpose lad.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Such were these Hags, and so unhandsome drest:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who when they nigh approching had espyde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sir Artegall, return’d from his late quest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They both arose, and at him loudly cryde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As it had bene two shepheards curres had scryde</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A ravenous Wolfe amongst the scattered flockes:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Envie first, as she that first him eyde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Towardes him runs, and, with rude flaring lockes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About her eares, does beat her brest and forhead knockes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then from her mouth the gobbet she does take,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which whyleare she was so greedily</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Devouring, even that halfe-gnawen snake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And at him throwes it most despightfully:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The cursed Serpent, though she hungrily</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Earst chawd thereon, yet was not all so dead</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that some life remayned secretly;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, as he past afore withouten dread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bit him behind, that long the marke was to be read.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then th’other comming neare gan him revile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fouly rayle with all she could invent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying that he had, with unmanly guile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And foule abusion, both his honour blent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that bright sword, the sword of Justice lent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had stayned with reprochfull crueltie</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In guiltlesse blood of many an innocent:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As for Grandtorto, him with treacherie</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And traynes having surpriz’d, he fouly did to die.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thereto the Blatant Beast, by them set on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At him began aloud to barke and bay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With bitter rage and fell contention,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all the woods and rockes nigh to that way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began to quake and tremble with dismay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the aire rebellowed againe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So dreadfully his hundred tongues did bray:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And evermore those hags them selves did paine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To sharpen him, and their owne cursed tongs did straine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And still among most bitter wordes they spake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Most shamefull, most unrighteous, most untrew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That they the mildest man alive would make</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forget his patience, and yeeld vengeaunce dew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To her, that so false sclaunders at him threw:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more, to make them pierce and wound more deepe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She with the sting which in her vile tongue grew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did sharpen them, and in fresh poyson steepe:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet he past on, and seem’d of them to take no keepe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Talus, hearing her so lewdly raile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And speake so ill of him that well deserved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would her have chastiz’d with his yron flaile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If her Sir Artegall had not preserved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And him forbidden, who his heast observed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So much the more at him still did she scold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And stones did cast; yet he for nought would swerve</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From his right course, but still the way did hold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Faerie Court; where what him fell shall else be told.</span>
